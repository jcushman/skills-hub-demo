Let me search for comparable courses.\n\n<search>constitutional law individual rights syllabus due process equal protection First Amendment law school casebook</search>\n\n<search>constitutional law II individual rights syllabus Harvard Yale Stanford law school</search>\n\n<search>Stone Seidman Sunstein Tushnet constitutional law casebook syllabus individual rights</search>\n\n<search>Chemerinsky constitutional law individual rights syllabus due process equal protection First Amendment</search>\n\nLet me ask a few quick questions before I finalize the design, since your answers will affect pacing and case selection significantly:\n\n1. **Casebook**: Are you using a specific casebook (e.g., Stone/Seidman/Sunstein/Tushnet, Chemerinsky/Gillian, Sullivan/Feldman, Dorf/Morrison)? Or should I build from a canonical case list?\n\n2. **Student population**: Is this a 1L required course, an upper-level elective, or a seminar? That affects how much I assume students already know about judicial review, tiers of scrutiny, etc.\n\n3. **First Amendment scope**: The First Amendment alone can fill a semester. Do you want the full sweep — speech, press, religion (both clauses) — or do you want to prioritize certain areas and compress others? For example, many individual-rights courses give religion clauses only 2-3 sessions while spending 8-10 on free speech.\n\n4. **Due process scope**: Substantive due process only, or both substantive and procedural? And how do you want to handle the incorporation doctrine — as a standalone unit or woven into the substantive DP discussion?\n\n5. **Any cases or topics you consider non-negotiable?** (e.g., *Dobbs*, *Obergefell*, *Bruen*, *303 Creative*)\n\n6. **Dates**: Do you want actual calendar dates, or session numbers only?\n\nWhile you answer, here is my preliminary read on how the 42 sessions should be distributed across your three areas, based on standard individual-rights course patterns:\n\n| Area | Approx. Sessions | Rationale |\n|---|---|---|\n| Due Process (substantive + procedural + incorporation) | 10–12 | Foundational tier-of-scrutiny logic; must precede EP |\n| Equal Protection | 12–14 | Race, sex, sexual orientation, fundamental rights EP — the largest doctrinal block |\n| First Amendment | 14–16 | Speech alone justifies 10+ sessions; religion adds 4–6 |\n| Review | 2 | Dead week / exam prep |\n\nThis leaves essentially no room for structural material, which matches your instruction. Let me know your answers and I'll build the full session-by-session schedule."

This affects whether I need to build in scaffolding for tiers of scrutiny or can assume prior exposure.\n\n2. **First Amendment scope**: Chemerinsky Chapters 11–16 cover speech and religion. Do you want the full sweep of both, or do you want to compress religion (Establishment + Free Exercise) to make more room for speech doctrine?\n\n3. **Substantive vs. procedural due process**: Chemerinsky Chapter 10 covers both. Do you want equal time on procedural DP, or should I treat it as a brief unit (1–2 sessions) and spend the bulk of the DP allocation on substantive DP?\n\n4. **Any non-negotiable cases or recent decisions** you want foregrounded — e.g., *Dobbs*, *Bruen*, *303 Creative*, *Kennedy v. Bremerton*?\n\n5. **Calendar dates or session numbers only?**\n\nIn the meantime, here is my refined preliminary allocation based on Chemerinsky Chapters 8–16:\n\n| Chemerinsky Chapter | Topic | Preliminary Sessions |\n|---|---|---|\n| Ch. 8 | The Incorporation Doctrine | 1–2 |\n| Ch. 9 | Economic Liberties / Rational Basis | 2–3 |\n| Ch. 10 | Due Process (Procedural + Substantive) | 8–10 |\n| Ch. 11 | Equal Protection (Race, Sex, Fundamental Rights) | 10–12 |\n| Ch. 12 | First Amendment — Speech (Content, Categories) | 6–8 |\n| Ch. 13 | First Amendment — Speech (Time/Place/Manner, etc.) | 4–5 |\n| Ch. 14 | First Amendment — Speech (Special Contexts) | 2–3 |\n| Ch. 15 | First Amendment — Religion (Free Exercise) | 2–3 |\n| Ch. 16 | First Amendment — Religion (Establishment) | 2–3 |\n| Review | Dead week / exam prep | 2 |\n| **Total** | | **~42** |\n\nOnce you answer the questions above — especially the First Amendment scope question and student population — I can lock in the session counts and build the full case-by-case schedule."
