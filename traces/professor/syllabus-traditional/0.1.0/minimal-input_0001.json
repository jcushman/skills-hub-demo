Source Material\nPlease share any of the following:\n- **Upload your casebook's table of contents** (a photo or PDF works great)\n- **Paste the table of contents** as text\n- **Tell me the casebook title, author(s), and edition** so I can work from its structure\n\nCommon Property casebooks include:\n- Dukeminier, Krier, Alexander & Schill, *Property* (9th ed.)\n- Singer, Berger, Davidson & Penalver, *Property Law* (various eds.)\n- Merrill & Smith, *Property: Principles and Policies* (various eds.)\n- Sprankling, *Understanding Property Law*\n- Nelson, Stoebuck & Whitman, *Contemporary Property*\n\n### 2. Course Logistics\nPlease tell me:\n- **How many class sessions** do you have? (e.g., 42 sessions over a 14-week semester)\n- **Session length** (e.g., 50 minutes, 75 minutes, 80 minutes)\n- **Credit hours** (3, 4, or 5 credits?)\n- **Is this a full-year or single-semester course?**\n- **Any topics you know you want to emphasize or cut?**\n\n### 3. Assessment Preferences\n- Final exam only, or do you also want midterms, papers, or participation grades?\n\n---\n\nOnce you share the casebook and logistics, I'll research comparable syllabi from other law schools and build you a complete, session-by-session traditional Socratic syllabus."
