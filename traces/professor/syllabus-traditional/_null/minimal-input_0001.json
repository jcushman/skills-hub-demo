(weeks)\n- How many class sessions per week?\n- How long is each class session?\n- Is this 1L or upper-level?\n- How many credit hours?\n\n**Materials**\n- Which casebook are you using? (e.g., Dukeminier, Property; Singer, Property; Sprankling, etc.)\n- Any supplemental texts or materials?\n\n**Course Scope**\n- What topics do you want to cover or emphasize?\n- Any topics you want to exclude?\n- Do you cover landlord-tenant law? Future interests? Zoning/land use?\n\n**Assessments**\n- Midterm exam? Final exam?\n- Papers or problem sets?\n- Participation/cold calling policy?\n\n**Other Preferences**\n- Any specific cases you always include?\n- Do you incorporate policy discussions or interdisciplinary materials?\n- Any accommodations or course policies you want included?\n\n---\n\nOnce you share these details, I can build out a **week-by-week syllabus** with reading assignments, learning objectives, and course policies tailored to your class."
