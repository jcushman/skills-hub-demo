They're absorbing content without a map.\n\n*Diagnostic question:* Could your students articulate, in their own words, what they're supposed to be able to *do* by the end of your course?\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Mismatch Between Teaching and Assessment**\nYou're teaching one thing (doctrine, policy analysis, synthesis) but testing another — or students perceive a mismatch even if one doesn't exist.\n\n*Diagnostic question:* Have you made explicit to students how class discussion connects to what they'll be asked to do on exams or papers?\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Cognitive Load Issues**\nLaw courses often front-load complexity. Students hit a wall when too many new concepts arrive simultaneously without scaffolding.\n\n*Diagnostic question:* Are there points in the semester where you introduce multiple difficult concepts in quick succession?\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Socratic Method Without Sufficient Anchoring**\nClassic Socratic dialogue is generative but can leave students uncertain about what the \"right\" answer or framework actually is. They leave class unsure what to take away.\n\n*Diagnostic question:* Do you regularly provide explicit synthesis or takeaways after Socratic exchanges?\n\n---\n\n### 5. **Assumed Background Knowledge**\nYou know this material deeply. Students may be missing foundational pieces you've stopped noticing you rely on.\n\n*Diagnostic question:* Are there concepts you reference without defining because they feel obvious to you?\n\n---\n\n## Where to Start\n\nA few targeted questions would help me give you more specific advice:\n\n1. **What course is this?** (1L required, upper-level seminar, clinic, etc.)\n2. **What format do you primarily use?** (Socratic, lecture, discussion, hybrid)\n3. **Do you have a sense of *when* in the course confusion peaks** — beginning, middle, end, or throughout?\n4. **What does your current syllabus look like in terms of stated objectives?**\n\nEven answering one or two of those will let us get much more concrete."
