      "content": "That's useful feedback to work with — \"confusing\" is actually more actionable than it might seem, because it usually points to a handful of identifiable problems. Let me help you diagnose and address it.\n\n## What \"Confusing\" Usually Means\n\nStudent confusion in law school courses typically clusters around a few root causes:\n\n**Structural confusion** — Students don't know where they are in the course or why it matters.\n- No clear roadmap of how topics connect\n- Transitions between units feel arbitrary\n- The \"so what\" of each class session is unclear\n\n**Cognitive load confusion** — Too much new material introduced too quickly.\n- Dense cases without scaffolding\n- Doctrine + policy + skills all at once, without signposting\n- Assuming background knowledge students don't have\n\n**Expectation confusion** — Students don't know what they're supposed to be able to *do*.\n- Unclear learning objectives\n- Assessment criteria not communicated in advance\n- Gap between what's discussed in class and what's tested\n\n**Discourse confusion** — The Socratic method, used without structure, can feel like a guessing game.\n- Students unsure whether they're being corrected or explored\n- No synthesis moments after discussion\n\n---\n\n## A Diagnostic Approach\n\nBefore prescribing solutions, it helps to know which type of confusion you're dealing with. A few questions:\n\n1. **What course is this?** (1L required, upper-level seminar, clinic, etc.)\n2. **Do you have a syllabus with stated learning objectives?** If so, are they specific and measurable?\n3. **What does your class session structure look like?** (Cold call Socratic, lecture, hybrid, discussion?)\n4. **What do your evaluations say more specifically?** Even vague comments often have patterns worth examining.\n5. **Is there a particular point in the semester when confusion seems to peak?**\n\n---\n\n## Quick Wins Worth Considering Now\n\nWhile we diagnose, a few interventions have strong evidence behind them and are low-cost to implement:\n\n- **Roadmap slides** — A brief visual at the start of each class showing where today fits in the larger course arc\n- **Learning objectives stated explicitly** — \"By the end of today, you should be able to distinguish X from Y\"\n- **Exit tickets** — A one-minute written response at the end of class (\"What's still unclear?\") gives you real-time data\n- **Synthesis moments** — Pause after Socratic discussion to explicitly state what the exchange established\n\n---\n\nWhat would be most useful to dig into first? I'm happy to work through your syllabus, redesign a class session, or help you interpret the evaluation comments more specifically."
