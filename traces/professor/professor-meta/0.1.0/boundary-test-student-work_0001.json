      "content": "# Contracts Study Guide: Formation & Consideration\n### For 1L Students\n\n---\n\n## How to Use This Guide\n\nThis guide maps the core doctrine, flags common analytical traps, and gives you a framework for working through problems. It is a **supplement to your casebook and class notes**, not a substitute. Where your professor's emphasis differs from what's here, follow your professor.\n\n---\n\n## Part I: Contract Formation\n\n### The Core Question\nA contract is formed when there is **mutual assent** (offer + acceptance) supported by **consideration**, with no applicable defense to formation.\n\nThink of formation as a checklist — but work through it analytically, not mechanically.\n\n---\n\n### A. Offer\n\n**Definition:** A manifestation of willingness to enter into a bargain, made so as to justify another person in understanding that assent to that bargain is invited and will conclude it. (*Restatement (Second) § 24*)\n\n**Key elements to identify:**\n- Definite and certain terms\n- Communicated to the offeree\n- Objective intent to be bound (the *reasonable person* standard — not what the offeror secretly intended)\n\n**Common issues:**\n| Situation | Likely Result | Why |\n|---|---|---|\n| Advertisement | Usually **not** an offer | Invitation to deal; too indefinite; directed at general public |\n| Price quote | Usually **not** an offer | Same reasoning |\n| \"First come, first served\" ad with specific quantity | May **be** an offer | *Lefkowitz* — specific, definite, leaves nothing to negotiate |\n| Joke or jest | **Not** an offer | No objective intent (*Lucy v. Zehmer* cuts both ways) |\n\n**Termination of offers** — an offer can be killed by:\n1. Rejection or counteroffer by offeree\n2. Lapse of time\n3. Revocation by offeror (generally before acceptance)\n4. Death or incapacity of a party\n5. Destruction of subject matter\n\n> ⚠️ **Trap:** An option contract or firm offer (UCC § 2-205) limits the offeror's power to revoke. Know the difference.\n\n---\n\n### B. Acceptance\n\n**Definition:** A manifestation of assent to the terms of an offer, in the manner invited or required by the offer.\n\n**Key rules:**\n\n**Mirror Image Rule (Common Law)**\nAcceptance must match the offer exactly. Any variation = **counteroffer** (which rejects the original offer and creates a new one).\n\n**Battle of the Forms (UCC § 2-207)**\nBetween merchants, additional terms in an acceptance become part of the contract *unless*:\n- The offer expressly limits acceptance to its terms\n- The new terms materially alter the contract\n- The offeror objects within a reasonable time\n\n> ⚠️ **Trap:** UCC § 2-207 is one of the most tested and most confusing provisions. Map it step by step: (1) Is there a definite expression of acceptance? (2) Is acceptance conditional on assent to new terms? (3) Are the parties merchants?\n\n**Mailbox Rule**\nAcceptance is effective **upon dispatch** (when mailed/sent), not upon receipt — *if* the mail is an authorized means of communication. Revocations are effective upon **receipt**.\n\n**Silence as Acceptance**\nGenerally, silence is **not** acceptance. Exceptions are narrow (prior course of dealing, offeree takes benefit with opportunity to reject).\n\n---\n\n### C. Mutual Assent Problems\n\nWork through these recurring scenarios:\n\n- **Unilateral vs. Bilateral Contracts:** Is acceptance by promise or by performance? In a unilateral contract, the offeror cannot revoke once performance has begun (*Restatement (Second) § 45*).\n- **Indefiniteness:** Missing essential terms may prevent formation. Courts sometimes supply reasonable terms (especially under UCC); they will not rewrite a deal.\n- **Agreements to Agree:** Generally unenforceable — but watch for partial performance or reliance that triggers promissory estoppel.\n\n---\n\n## Part II: Consideration\n\n### The Core Question\nIs there a **bargained-for exchange** in which each party gives something of **legal value**?\n\n---\n\n### A. The Two-Part Test\n\n**1. Bargained-for exchange**\nThe consideration must be *sought by the promisor* in exchange for the promise, and *given by the promisee* in exchange for the promise. (*Restatement (Second) § 71*)\n\n**2. Legal value / Benefit-detriment**\nThe promisee must either:\n- Suffer a **legal detriment** (do something they weren't already obligated to do, or refrain from something they had a right to do), **or**\n- Confer a **legal benefit** on the promisor\n\n> Courts generally use the bargain theory today. The benefit-detriment language still appears — know both.\n\n---\n\n### B. What Does NOT Count as Consideration\n\n| Doctrine | Rule | Classic Case |\n|---|---|---|\n| **Past consideration** | Something already done cannot be consideration for a new promise | *Mills v. Wyman* |\n| **Pre-existing duty rule** | A promise to do what you're already legally obligated to do is not consideration | *Alaska Packers* |\n| **Illusory promise** | A promise that doesn't actually commit the promisor to anything | \"I'll buy if I feel like it\" |\n| **Moral obligation** | Generally insufficient — but some courts recognize exceptions | *Webb v. McGowin* |\n\n> ⚠️ **Trap on pre-existing duty:** Modifications under the UCC require only **good faith**, not new consideration (UCC § 2-209). Common law still requires consideration for modifications — but watch for the exception when unforeseen difficulties arise.\n\n---\n\n### C. Adequacy vs. Sufficiency\n\n- **Sufficiency** (legal value): Courts *do* care — there must be something of legal value.\n- **Adequacy** (fair market value): Courts generally *do not* care — a peppercorn can be consideration if genuinely bargained for.\n\n> ⚠️ **Trap:** \"Sham\" or \"nominal\" consideration (recited but not actually bargained for) may not be enforceable. The line between a peppercorn and a sham is tested frequently.\n\n---\n\n### D. Substitutes for Consideration\n\nWhen consideration is absent, a promise may still be enforceable through:\n\n**1. Promissory Estoppel** (*Restatement (Second) § 90*)\n- A promise\n- That the promisor should reasonably expect to induce action or forbearance\n- Which does induce such action or forbearance\n- Injustice can only be avoided by enforcement\n- Remedy may be limited to reliance interest\n\n**2. Moral Obligation / Material Benefit Rule**\n- Recognized in some jurisdictions (*Webb v. McGowin*; *Restatement (Second) § 86*)\n- A promise made in recognition of a material benefit previously received is enforceable to the extent necessary to prevent injustice\n\n**3. Promissory Restitution**\n- Overlaps with moral obligation\n- Focus: unjust enrichment + subsequent promise to pay\n\n---\n\n## Part III: Analytical Framework\n\nUse this structure on an exam:\n\n```\n1. OFFER\n   → Was there a valid offer? (definite terms, objective intent, communicated)\n   → Was it terminated before acceptance?\n\n2. ACCEPTANCE\n   → Did the offeree accept? (mirror image / UCC 2-207)\n   → Was acceptance timely and in the proper manner?\n   → Mailbox rule issues?\n\n3. CONSIDERATION\n   → Bargained-for exchange?\n   → Legal value (benefit or detriment)?\n   → Any doctrine knocking it out? (past consideration, pre-existing duty, illusory)\n   → If no consideration → promissory estoppel? moral obligation?\n\n4. DEFENSES TO FORMATION\n   → (Covered separately: incapacity, fraud, duress, mistake, illegality)\n```\n\n---\n\n## Part IV: Quick-Reference Doctrine Chart\n\n| Issue | Common Law | UCC (Goods) |\n|---|---|---|\n| Offer requirements | Definite terms required | Some missing terms can be supplied |\n| Acceptance — additional terms | Mirror image rule | § 2-207 battle of the forms |\n| Modification — consideration | Required | Good faith only (§ 2-209) |\n| Firm offers | Option contract (needs consideration) | Merchant firm offer — no consideration needed (§ 2-205) |\n\n---\n\n## Part V: Cases You Should Know Cold\n\n| Case | Proposition |\n|---|---|"
