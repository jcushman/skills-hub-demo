      "content": "Great project — a Law and Technology seminar has enormous potential right now, and starting from first principles will save you significant redesign work later. Here's how I'd approach it:\n\n---\n\n## Start with Three Foundational Questions\n\n**1. What should students be able to *do* when they leave?**\nNot just \"understand AI regulation\" but something like: *analyze a novel technology through multiple legal frameworks, identify regulatory gaps, and construct a policy argument.* These terminal competencies will drive everything else — readings, assignments, class structure.\n\n**2. Who is your student?**\nUpper-level students bring doctrinal foundation but vary widely in technical literacy. Will you assume any? Require a prerequisite? Plan to build it in? Your answer shapes how much time you spend on technical scaffolding versus legal analysis.\n\n**3. What is the *spine* of the course?**\nLaw and Technology is vast. You need an organizing principle. A few common approaches:\n\n| Spine | Strength | Risk |\n|---|---|---|\n| **Technology-by-technology** (AI, biotech, crypto...) | Intuitive structure | Can feel like disconnected modules |\n| **Legal domain** (IP, privacy, liability, speech...) | Doctrinal coherence | May underweight the tech itself |\n| **Theoretical/jurisprudential** (Lessig's modalities, law's lag, regulatory theory) | Intellectual depth | Can feel abstract without grounding |\n| **Problem-centered** (autonomous vehicles, facial recognition, LLMs...) | High engagement | Requires careful scaffolding |\n\nMany strong syllabi combine a theoretical frame early, then move to problem-centered units.\n\n---\n\n## Practical Next Steps\n\n1. **Draft 4–6 learning objectives** before touching readings. Use action verbs (analyze, evaluate, construct, critique). I can help you develop these.\n\n2. **Decide on the signature assignment** — the major deliverable that demonstrates mastery. A policy memo? Regulatory comment? Scholarly paper? This decision shapes the whole course arc.\n\n3. **Map backwards** from that assignment to identify what students need to know and practice along the way.\n\n4. **Then** build the reading list and class sequence.\n\n---\n\n## A Question Back to You\n\nWhat draws *you* to this topic right now — is there a particular technology, legal problem, or jurisprudential question that feels most urgent or generative to you? That's often the best place to anchor the course intellectually, and it tends to produce better teaching."

      "content": "Good scope — those four topics have genuine coherence (they're all fundamentally about how law mediates the relationship between data-driven systems and people), and 14 sessions is workable if you're disciplined about depth versus breadth.\n\nLet me show you a structural problem to solve first, then a proposed architecture.\n\n---\n\n## The Math Problem\n\nFour topics, 14 sessions. If you divide evenly, that's 3–4 sessions per topic. But you also need:\n\n- **Opening sessions** (framing, theory, technical literacy)\n- **Closing sessions** (synthesis, student presentations)\n- Probably **1 buffer** (you will use it)\n\nRealistic content sessions: **10–11**. That's roughly **2–3 sessions per topic** — enough for depth on a focused question within each area, not comprehensive coverage.\n\nThis means your job is to pick **one or two hard problems per topic** rather than surveying the field. That's actually pedagogically stronger for a seminar.\n\n---\n\n## Proposed Architecture\n\n| Sessions | Unit | Focus |\n|---|---|---|\n| 1–2 | **Foundations** | How should law respond to technological change? Theoretical frames (Lessig, Wu, Cohen). Basic technical literacy on AI/data systems. |\n| 3–5 | **AI Regulation** | Liability for algorithmic harm; EU AI Act vs. US approach; sector-specific vs. horizontal regulation |\n| 6–8 | **Platform Liability** | Section 230 doctrine and reform debates; content moderation as governance; First Amendment complications |\n| 9–11 | **Privacy** | Fourth Amendment in the digital age; GDPR/state law frameworks; data broker ecosystem |\n| 12–13 | **Surveillance** | Government surveillance (post-Carpenter); biometrics and facial recognition; private surveillance and the public/private distinction |\n| 14 | **Synthesis** | Cross-cutting themes; student presentations or policy debate |\n\n---\n\n## Three Design Decisions to Make Now\n\n**1. How much do the units talk to each other?**\nThese topics genuinely intersect — platform liability and AI regulation collide in content moderation; privacy and surveillance are nearly continuous. You could treat units as discrete modules, or you could build explicit connective tissue (a recurring hypothetical that evolves across units, for instance). The latter is more sophisticated but requires more design work.\n\n**2. What's the signature assignment?**\nFor a 2-credit seminar, common options:\n\n- **Seminar paper** (15–25 pages) — traditional, develops scholarly writing\n- **Regulatory comment** on a pending rule — practical, high engagement, teaches a real genre\n- **Policy memo** — shorter, more accessible, good for students going into practice or government\n- **Presentation + shorter paper** — works well if you want significant in-class student contribution\n\nMy suggestion: given your four topics, a **regulatory comment or policy memo on a specific AI/platform/privacy problem** would let students synthesize across units and produce something professionally useful. But if your students are research-track, a paper may serve them better.\n\n**3. What's your formative assessment strategy?**\n14 sessions with only a final paper is a common seminar mistake — students disengage mid-course and you lose visibility into their learning. Consider:\n- Weekly response papers (short, low-stakes)\n- One or two in-class presentations per student\n- A proposal/outline checkpoint for the major assignment\n- Discussion leadership rotation\n\n---\n\n## What I'd Suggest as an Immediate Next Step\n\nDraft your **learning objectives** for each unit — 2–3 per unit, action-verb driven. That will tell you quickly whether your reading selections are doing the right work and whether your assignment actually assesses what you care about.\n\nWant me to draft a first pass at learning objectives for all four units, or would you rather start by working through one unit in detail?"
