      "content": "# Contracts Study Guide: Formation & Consideration\n### For First-Year Law Students\n\n---\n\n## OVERVIEW\n\nContract formation requires mutual assent (offer + acceptance) and consideration. Without these elements, no enforceable contract exists. This guide walks through each component systematically.\n\n---\n\n## PART ONE: CONTRACT FORMATION\n\n### I. The Basic Requirements\n\nFor a valid contract, you need:\n1. **Offer**\n2. **Acceptance**\n3. **Consideration**\n4. **No defenses to formation** (covered separately)\n\n---\n\n### II. OFFER\n\n#### A. Definition\nAn offer is a manifestation of willingness to enter into a bargain, made so as to justify another person in understanding that their assent to that bargain is invited and will conclude it. *See Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 24.*\n\n#### B. Key Elements of a Valid Offer\n- **Intent** — Objective manifestation of present intent to be bound (not merely preliminary negotiation)\n- **Definite Terms** — Sufficient certainty of essential terms\n- **Communication** — Must be communicated to the offeree\n\n> 💡 **The Objective Theory of Contracts:** Courts ask what a *reasonable person* in the position of the offeree would have understood, NOT what the offeror subjectively intended. *Lucy v. Zehmer*, 196 Va. 493 (1954).\n\n#### C. Offers vs. Non-Offers\n| **Likely an Offer** | **Likely NOT an Offer** |\n|---|---|\n| Specific terms directed at specific party | General advertisements |\n| Language of commitment (\"I will sell...\") | Price quotes / catalogs |\n| Signed written proposal | Invitations to negotiate |\n| Reward announcements (to public) | Letters of intent (usually) |\n\n> ⚠️ **Exception:** An advertisement CAN be an offer if it is specific, leaves nothing open for negotiation, and invites a specific act of acceptance. *Lefkowitz v. Great Minneapolis Surplus Store*, 251 Minn. 188 (1957).\n\n#### D. Termination of an Offer\nAn offer can be terminated by:\n1. **Revocation** — Offeror withdraws before acceptance (generally effective upon receipt)\n2. **Rejection** — Offeree declines\n3. **Counteroffer** — Operates as rejection + new offer\n4. **Lapse of Time** — After a reasonable time or stated deadline\n5. **Death or Incapacity** — Of either party (generally)\n6. **Destruction of Subject Matter**\n\n> 💡 **Irrevocable Offers — Options:** An offer is irrevocable if supported by consideration (an option contract). *Restatement § 87(1).*\n\n---\n\n### III. ACCEPTANCE\n\n#### A. Definition\nAcceptance is a manifestation of assent to the terms of an offer in the manner invited or required by the offer. *Restatement § 50.*\n\n#### B. Who May Accept?\nOnly the **offeree** — the person to whom the offer was directed.\n\n#### C. Mirror Image Rule (Common Law)\nAcceptance must be **unconditional and unequivocal** — it must mirror the offer exactly. Any change in terms = **counteroffer**, not acceptance.\n\n#### D. UCC § 2-207 — Battle of the Forms\nUnder the UCC (for goods), different or additional terms in an acceptance do **not** automatically defeat acceptance.\n- Between **merchants**: additional terms become part of the contract *unless* they materially alter it, the offer limits acceptance to its terms, or the offeror objects.\n- Between **non-merchants**: additional terms are proposals only.\n\n> ⚠️ **Common Exam Trap:** Know when to apply common law vs. UCC. UCC Article 2 governs contracts for the **sale of goods**. Common law governs services, real estate, and employment.\n\n#### E. Methods of Acceptance\n- **Bilateral contract** — Promise for a promise; acceptance by return promise\n- **Unilateral contract** — Promise for an act; acceptance by full performance\n- **Ambiguous offer** — Either method may be used (*Restatement § 32*)\n\n#### F. The Mailbox Rule\nAcceptance is effective upon **dispatch** (when sent), not upon receipt — *if* use of mail/similar means is reasonable.\n- Exceptions: Option contracts (effective on receipt); if offer specifies otherwise\n\n---\n\n## PART TWO: CONSIDERATION\n\n### I. Definition and Purpose\n\nConsideration is the **bargained-for exchange** that makes a promise legally enforceable. It distinguishes enforceable contracts from unenforceable gifts or moral obligations.\n\n**Two-Part Test:**\n1. Was there a **bargained-for exchange**? (Did each party give something to induce the other's promise?)\n2. Did the promisee **suffer a legal detriment** OR did the promisor receive a **legal benefit**?\n\n*Hamer v. Sidway*, 124 N.Y. 538 (1891) — Nephew's forbearance from legal activities (drinking, gambling) constituted valid consideration.\n\n---\n\n### II. What Qualifies as Consideration?\n\n| **Qualifies** | **Does NOT Qualify** |\n|---|---|\n| A return promise | A past act (past consideration) |\n| Performance of an act | A pre-existing legal duty |\n| Forbearance from a legal right | Illusory promises |\n| Transfer of property | Moral obligation (generally) |\n\n---\n\n### III. Common Consideration Pitfalls\n\n#### A. Past Consideration\nAn act already performed **before** the promise was made cannot serve as consideration — it was not bargained for.\n\n> *Example:* A rescues B from drowning. B later promises to pay A $500 for saving her life. B's promise is unenforceable — A's act was past.\n\n#### B. Pre-Existing Duty Rule\nA promise to do something you are **already legally obligated** to do is not valid consideration.\n\n> *Example:* A contractor agrees to build your house for $100,000. Midway through, he demands an extra $20,000 or he'll stop. Your promise to pay the extra $20,000 is generally unenforceable.\n\n> 💡 **Exception (UCC § 2-209):** Modifications to contracts for goods need **no** consideration if made in good faith.\n\n> 💡 **Exception (Common Law):** Modifications supported by **new consideration** or involving **unforeseen difficulties** may be enforceable.\n\n#### C. Illusory Promises\nA promise that leaves performance entirely to the promisor's discretion is **illusory** and not valid consideration.\n\n> *Example:* \"I'll buy your car if I feel like it.\" This is not a real promise — no consideration.\n\n> 💡 **Exception:** Requirements and output contracts are NOT illusory because they impose an obligation of good faith. *UCC § 2-306.*\n\n#### D. Moral Obligation / Material Benefit Rule\nGenerally, moral obligation alone is **not** consideration. However, some courts enforce promises made in recognition of a **material benefit** previously received. *Webb v. McGowin*, 27 Ala. App. 82 (1935).\n\n---\n\n### IV. Adequacy vs. Sufficiency of Consideration\n\n| | **Sufficiency** | **Adequacy** |\n|---|---|---|\n| **Definition** | Whether consideration legally qualifies | Whether consideration is of equal value |\n| **Courts examine?** | ✅ Yes | ❌ Generally No |\n| **Key Point** | Must be a real legal detriment | Courts don't police fairness of the bargain |\n\n> 💡 **Peppercorn Theory:** Even a peppercorn can be valid consideration — courts do not require equivalence of value, only that a genuine bargain exists.\n\n---\n\n### V. Substitutes for Consideration\n\nWhen consideration is absent, a promise may still be enforceable through:\n\n#### A. Promissory Estoppel (Detrimental Reliance)\n*Restatement § 90:*\n1. Promisor made a **clear and definite promise**\n2. Promisor should have **reasonably expected** promisee to rely\n3. Promisee **actually and reasonably relied** on the promise\n4. **Injustice** can only be avoided by enforcement\n\n> *Example:* Employer promises employee a pension. Employee retires in reliance. Employer cannot revoke. *Feinberg v. Pfeiffer Co.*, 322 S.W.2d 163 (Mo. App. 1959).\n\n#### B. Quasi"
