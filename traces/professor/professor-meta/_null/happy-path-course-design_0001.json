Here are some foundational decisions that will shape everything else:\n\n## Start with Core Questions\n\n**What's the seminar's intellectual spine?** A few possible framings:\n- Law *regulating* technology (liability, privacy, IP)\n- Technology *transforming* law (courts, evidence, legal practice)\n- Deeper theoretical questions about how law and technology co-evolve\n\nPicking a clear angle prevents the course from becoming a scattered survey.\n\n## Key Design Decisions Early On\n\n**Level and prerequisites** - Are students expected to have legal background, technical literacy, or both? This dramatically affects reading selection and discussion depth.\n\n**Seminar format** - Weekly papers, case studies, guest practitioners, student-led sessions? Upper-level seminars often work best with significant student ownership.\n\n**Output** - Research paper, policy memo, presentation? This should drive backward design.\n\n## Some Honest Challenges to Plan For\n\n- The field moves *faster* than syllabi - build in flexibility\n- \"Technology\" can mean everything, which risks meaning nothing\n- Students often have strong intuitions but shallow analysis on tech topics\n\n## A Practical Starting Point\n\nI'd suggest **identifying 4-5 genuinely hard problems** you want students to wrestle with, then building readings around those tensions rather than starting with topics.\n\nWhat's your own research background? That might suggest where the seminar could have real intellectual depth rather than just coverage."

      "content": "That's a solid and coherent set of topics with real connective tissue between them. Here's how I'd think about structuring it:\n\n## The Math Problem First\n\n14 sessions, 4 topics, 2 credits means **roughly 3 sessions per topic** plus framing sessions. That's tight. You'll need to make genuine cuts within each area rather than trying to survey everything.\n\n## Suggested Arc\n\n**Sessions 1-2: Foundations**\n- What makes technology legally distinctive?\n- Theoretical frameworks (Lessig's \"Code,\" maybe Zittrain)\n\n**Sessions 3-5: Privacy**\n- Good anchor topic - connects everything that follows\n\n**Sessions 6-8: Surveillance**\n- Flows naturally from privacy, adds state power dimension\n\n**Sessions 9-11: Platform Liability**\n- Section 230, content moderation, recent legislative pressure\n\n**Sessions 12-14: AI Regulation**\n- Works well last because students can apply frameworks already built\n\n## A Few Strategic Suggestions\n\n- **Put AI last** - it benefits from the prior frameworks and feels most current\n- **Build explicit bridges** between units or they'll feel disconnected\n- **Reserve one session** for a live controversy or guest speaker\n- Consider whether a **comparative dimension** (EU vs. US approaches) runs throughout rather than as a separate topic\n\n## The Hard Question\n\nWhat's your **capstone assignment**? A 2-credit seminar often lives or dies on whether the final paper requirement gives students something genuinely challenging to argue.\n\nWhat's your instinct on assessment?"
