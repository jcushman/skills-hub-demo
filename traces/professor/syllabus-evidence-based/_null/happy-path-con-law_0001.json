Session counts per unit reflect both casebook depth (chapters allocated) and cognitive load research suggesting rights doctrine requires more processing time than structural doctrine.\n\n| Casebook Part | Chapters | Sessions Allocated | Rationale |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| I — Judicial Review | Ch. 1–2 | 4 | Foundational; every later unit depends on it |\n| II — Federalism & Commerce | Ch. 3–4 | 5 | Dense doctrine; high bar exam weight |\n| III — Separation of Powers | Ch. 5–6 | 5 | Conceptually abstract; needs extended application |\n| IV — Due Process | Ch. 7–8 | 5 | Substantive + procedural split; high complexity |\n| V — Equal Protection | Ch. 9–10 | 5 | Tiered scrutiny; most case-dense unit |\n| VI — First Amendment | Ch. 11–13 | **3 chapters → 4 sessions** | Three chapters warrant extra time |\n| Synthesis | — | 1 | Exam preparation + cross-unit integration |\n| **Total** | | **29 mapped → 28 delivered** | Session 28 absorbs one flex day |\n\n---\n\n## Recurring Structural Features\n\nEvery session follows this template, varied by activity type:\n\n```\n┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐\n│  OPEN (0–10 min)    │ Retrieval prompt OR connecting question│\n│  CORE (10–55 min)   │ Case analysis + doctrine building      │\n│  APPLY (55–70 min)  │ Hypo, debate, or small-group problem   │\n│  CLOSE (70–75 min)  │ Exit synthesis + next session preview  │\n└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘\n```\n\n**Five formal retrieval quizzes** open Sessions 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25 — ungraded, answers discussed immediately. Research basis: Roediger & Karpicke (2006) show retrieval practice produces 40–50% better long-term retention than restudying.\n\n**Three short writing assignments** (2 pages each) due Sessions 4, 12, and 19 — designed to force synthesis before exams, not merely before them.\n\n---\n\n---\n\n# UNIT 1 | JUDICIAL REVIEW\n## Casebook Part I, Chapters 1–2 | Sessions 1–4\n\n**Unit throughline:** *Where does the Court's authority come from, and what constrains it?*\nThis question is never fully answered — and students should leave Unit 1 knowing why that is productive rather than troubling.\n\n---\n\n### Session 1 | The Constitution as Legal Text — Method Before Cases\n\n**Learning objectives:**\n- Distinguish Bobbitt's six modalities of constitutional argument\n- Identify which modality Marshall uses in *Marbury* (preview)\n- Articulate why interpretive method is a threshold question, not a technical one\n\n**75-minute plan:**\n\n| Time | Activity | Format |\n|---|---|---|\n| 0–10 | Orientation: syllabus, cold-call protocol, grading | Lecture |\n| 10–30 | What kind of document is the Constitution? Text vs. statute vs. common law | Discussion |\n| 30–55 | Bobbitt's modalities applied to a single clause (Necessary and Proper) | Small groups → report out |\n| 55–70 | *Hylton v. United States* (1796): the forgotten pre-*Marbury* review moment | Cold call |\n| 70–75 | Exit: Write one sentence — what would it mean for the Constitution to have *no* authoritative interpreter? | Individual writing |\n\n**Assigned reading:** Casebook Ch. 1 introduction; Constitution Arts. I–III; Bobbitt modalities excerpt (course packet)\n\n**Pedagogical note:** Opening with interpretive method *before* the canonical case gives students a cognitive scaffold that improves comprehension of *Marbury*'s rhetorical structure (Schwartz, 2019, on frame-first instruction in law teaching).\n\n---\n\n### Session 2 | *Marbury v. Madison* — Establishing Judicial Review\n\n**Learning objectives:**\n- Reconstruct Marshall's three-question structure and identify the logical move in each\n- Distinguish judicial review from judicial supremacy\n- Evaluate the political context as relevant or irrelevant to the opinion's authority\n\n**75-minute plan:**\n\n| Time | Activity | Format |\n|---|---|---|\n| 0–15 | Cold call: facts, procedural posture, Jefferson's dilemma | Socratic |\n| 15–40 | Marshall's three questions — unpacking the rhetorical architecture | Lecture + discussion |\n| 40–62 | Small groups: Is Marshall's argument logically compelled or politically constructed? Groups must take a position and defend it | Group work → debate |\n| 62–75 | Debrief: introduce departmentalism (Jefferson, Jackson) and popular constitutionalism (Kramer) as live alternatives | Lecture |\n\n**Assigned reading:** *Marbury v. Madison* (1803) [Ch. 1]; Kramer excerpt on popular constitutionalism (course packet)\n\n**Concept alert:** Students consistently conflate judicial review (courts can invalidate laws) with judicial supremacy (courts have final word on constitutional meaning). Flag this distinction explicitly — it recurs in Sessions 3, 11, and 28.\n\n---\n\n### Session 3 | Limits on Judicial Review — Justiciability\n\n**Learning objectives:**\n- Apply the *Baker v. Carr* political question factors\n- Analyze standing under *Lujan*'s three-part test\n- Explain why justiciability doctrines are themselves contested\n\n**75-minute plan:**\n\n| Time | Activity | Format |\n|---|---|---|\n| 0–15 | Cold call: What is the political question doctrine *for*? (elicit multiple answers) | Socratic |\n| 15–35 | *Baker v. Carr* (1962) — the six-factor test; which factors do real work? | Lecture + discussion |\n| 35–55 | *Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife* (1992) — standing as a separation of powers tool | Case analysis |\n| 55–70 | Hypo workshop: Apply standing analysis to three modern fact patterns (environmental group, taxpayer, competitor) | Pairs |\n| 70–75 | Exit: Which justiciability limit is most susceptible to manipulation? One sentence. | Individual writing |\n\n**Assigned reading:** *Baker v. Carr* [Ch. 1]; *Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife* [Ch. 1]; casebook notes on ripeness and mootness\n\n**Spaced connection:** Ask students explicitly how *Lujan*'s standing requirement relates to *Marbury*'s claim that courts only decide \"cases and controversies.\"\n\n---\n\n### Session 4 | Constitutional Interpretation — Theory and Stakes\n\n**Learning objectives:**\n- Compare originalism (original intent vs. original public meaning) and living constitutionalism\n- Apply competing methods to produce different outcomes on the same hypothetical\n- Articulate why interpretive choice is not merely academic\n\n**75-minute plan:**\n\n| Time | Activity | Format |\n|---|---|---|\n| 0–15 | Originalism: Scalia's defense; distinguish intent from public meaning | Lecture |\n| 15–30 | Living constitutionalism: Brennan's Georgetown Address; Strauss on common-law constitutionalism | Lecture |\n| 30–60 | Structured role-play: Four groups assigned interpretive methods; each applies their method to the same hypothetical (Does the 14th Amendment prohibit partisan gerrymandering?) | Group work → presentations |\n| 60–75 | Synthesis: Why does method matter for *every* case that follows? Map methods onto upcoming units | Full class |\n\n**Assigned reading:** Scalia, *A Matter of Interpretation* excerpt; Brennan, Georgetown Address (1985); Strauss, *The Living Constitution* Ch. 1 (course packet)\n\n**✏️ Writing Assignment 1 due this session:** 2 pages — *Marbury* brief using IRAC + one paragraph identifying which Bobbitt modality Marshall primarily employs and why it matters.\n\n**"
