Identify and analyze the elements of major common law and statutory crimes\n2. Apply the Model Penal Code and compare it to common law approaches\n3. Evaluate competing theories of punishment using philosophical and empirical frameworks\n4. Critically assess how race, class, and gender intersect with criminal law doctrine and enforcement\n5.
