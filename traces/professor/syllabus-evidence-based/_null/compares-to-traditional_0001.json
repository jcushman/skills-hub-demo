Here's the core difference:\n\n## Traditional Block Syllabus\n- Organized around **content coverage** (\"Week 3: Chapter 5\")\n- Tells students *what* you'll teach\n- Sequence driven by textbook or instructor habit\n- Assessment often comes **after** teaching is complete\n\n## Evidence-Based Syllabus\n- Organized around **what students will be able to do**\n- Tells students *why* the sequence matters\n- Sequence driven by **learning science** (spacing, retrieval, interleaving)\n- Assessment is **woven throughout** as a learning tool\n\n---\n\n## Why Consider Switching?\n\n**The research problem with block teaching:**\n- Students cram, perform okay on exams, then forget\n- Massed practice feels productive but produces weak retention\n\n**What evidence suggests instead:**\n- **Spaced practice** - returning to concepts over time\n- **Retrieval practice** - low-stakes testing that actually builds memory\n- **Interleaving** - mixing topics improves transfer to new problems\n\n---\n\n## Practical Difference\n\n| | Traditional | Evidence-Based |\n|---|---|---|\n| Student question | \"What's on the test?\" | \"What should I be able to do?\" |\n| Your planning question | \"What do I cover?\" | \"What do students need to practice?\" |\n\n---\n\n**The honest answer:** It requires more upfront design work, but typically produces **better retention and transfer**.\n\nWhat subject do you teach? That might help make this more concrete."
