      "content": "I'd be glad to build an evidence-based Criminal Law syllabus for you. Before I dive in, I need a few pieces of information to make this accurate and useful rather than generic.\n\n---\n\n## A Few Quick Questions\n\n**1. Source material**\nWhich casebook are you using? Common options include:\n- Dressler & Garvey, *Cases and Materials on Criminal Law*\n- Kadish, Schulhofer & Barkow, *Criminal Law and Its Processes*\n- Kaplan, Weisberg & Binder, *Criminal Law: Cases and Materials*\n- Johnson & Cloud, *Criminal Law: Cases, Materials and Text*\n- Something else?\n\nIf you have a table of contents, syllabus from a prior year, or any other source material, please paste or upload it — that's what I'll use to build the reading assignments.\n\n**2. Course structure**\n- How many class sessions total? (Or: how many weeks, how many sessions per week?)\n- How long is each session? (50 min? 75 min? 3-hour once-a-week seminar?)\n- Credit hours?\n\n**3. Student population and course level**\n- Is this a 1L required course or an upper-level elective?\n- Any particular doctrinal emphases you want (e.g., more time on homicide, mens rea theory, defenses, or sentencing/policy)?\n\n**4. Assessment preferences**\n- Do you currently use a final exam only, or do you have midterms, problem sets, or other assessments?\n- Are you open to adding low-stakes cumulative exercises, or do you have institutional constraints?\n\n**5. Any topics you always cover or always skip?**\nFor example, some faculty spend significant time on inchoate offenses and conspiracy; others treat them lightly. Some include a sentencing unit; others end at conviction.\n\n---\n\nOnce you share this, I'll research existing Criminal Law syllabi from comparable courses, analyze the pacing patterns experienced faculty use, and build you a full session-by-session evidence-based syllabus with spiral return points, scaffolded complexity, and spaced practice built in."
