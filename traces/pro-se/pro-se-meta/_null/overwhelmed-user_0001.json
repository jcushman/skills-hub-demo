It makes sense you don't know where to start - these are all serious issues.\n\nLet me help you think through this practically.\n\n**First, some reassurance:**\n- All three of these have more options than most people realize\n- You don't necessarily need a paid lawyer for any of them\n- There are free resources specifically for situations like yours\n\n**For the eviction (most urgent - act fast):**\n- Contact your local Legal Aid office immediately - they provide free legal help for housing\n- Many areas have eviction diversion programs right now\n- You likely have more time than you think, even after getting a notice\n\n**For medical debt in collections:**\n- This is actually the least urgent and most negotiable\n- Collectors must stop contacting you if you request it in writing\n- Hospitals often have financial assistance programs even after debt goes to collections\n\n**For the car repossession:**\n- Depending on your state, you may have a redemption period to get it back\n- Or they may owe you money if it sells for more than you owe\n\n**Concrete next step I'd suggest:**\nCall 211 (free helpline) - they can connect you to local resources for all of these issues at once.\n\n**What feels most pressing to you right now?** We can focus there first so this feels less overwhelming."
