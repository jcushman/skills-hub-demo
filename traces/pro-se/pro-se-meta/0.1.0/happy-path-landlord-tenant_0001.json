      "content": "This is a really common situation, and the good news is that **tenants have strong legal protections around security deposits** in most states. Here's how to think about this and what you can do.\n\n---\n\n## First, Understand the Rules\n\nIn most states, landlords must:\n\n1. **Return your deposit within a set deadline** — usually 14 to 30 days after you move out (this varies by state)\n2. **Send you an itemized written list** of any deductions they're making, with receipts or estimates\n3. **Only deduct for specific things** — like actual damage you caused (beyond normal wear and tear), unpaid rent, or cleaning if the unit was left dirty\n\n**\"Normal wear and tear\"** means the gradual, expected deterioration from ordinary living — scuffed paint, minor carpet wear, small nail holes. Landlords generally *cannot* charge you for that.\n\nIf your landlord missed the deadline or didn't send a written itemization, many states penalize them — sometimes requiring them to pay you **double or triple** the deposit amount.\n\n---\n\n## Steps You Can Take Right Now\n\n### 1. Check Your State's Law\nSecurity deposit rules vary significantly by state. Search for **\"[your state] security deposit law\"** or visit **[Nolo.com](https://www.nolo.com)** — they have plain-language summaries for every state.\n\n### 2. Send a Demand Letter\nWrite a formal letter (email with read receipt, or certified mail) to your landlord stating:\n- The amount of the deposit\n- That you left the unit clean and in good condition\n- That you demand the deposit be returned within a specific timeframe (e.g., 10–14 days)\n- That you're aware of your rights under state law\n\nThis creates a paper trail and often prompts landlords to act.\n\n### 3. Gather Your Evidence\n- Move-out photos or videos\n- Your move-in checklist (if you have one)\n- Any written communication with your landlord\n- Receipts for cleaning supplies, if applicable\n\n### 4. Consider Small Claims Court\nIf the landlord still won't return your deposit, **small claims court** is designed exactly for situations like this — no lawyer required, lower filing fees, and simpler procedures. Many people successfully represent themselves. Filing limits vary by state but are often $5,000–$10,000.\n\n---\n\n## Get Help\n\n- **Legal Aid** (free for income-qualifying people): Find your local office at **[lawhelp.org](https://www.lawhelp.org)**\n- **Tenant Rights Organizations**: Search **\"tenant rights [your city or state]\"**\n- **Court Self-Help Centers**: Many courthouses have free help for people representing themselves\n- **Your State Bar's Lawyer Referral Service**: Often offers a low-cost initial consultation\n\n---\n\nDo you know what state you're in? I can help you look up the specific rules and deadlines that apply to your situation. And do you have any documentation from when you moved out — like photos or a move-out checklist?"

      "content": "Good news: **Texas law is pretty clear on this, and it sounds like your landlord may already be in violation.**\n\n---\n\n## Texas Security Deposit Law (Plain Language)\n\nUnder the **Texas Property Code, Section 92.103–92.109**, your landlord must:\n\n1. **Return your deposit within 30 days** of you moving out\n2. **If they make deductions**, send you a written, itemized list of what they kept and why — along with any remaining balance\n\nYou moved out a month ago. If it's been more than 30 days and you've received **nothing** — no money, no explanation — your landlord has likely violated Texas law.\n\n---\n\n## The Key Penalty\n\nHere's the important part:\n\n> If a landlord **in bad faith** fails to return the deposit or provide an itemization, Texas law allows you to sue for:\n> - **$100** (statutory penalty)\n> - **3 times the amount wrongfully withheld**\n> - **Your attorney's fees**\n\nOn a $1,200 deposit, that could mean up to **$3,700** if a court finds bad faith. \"Bad faith\" generally means the landlord had no legitimate reason and just ignored the law.\n\n---\n\n## What To Do Right Now\n\n### Step 1: Send a Demand Letter (Do This First)\nSend a written demand by **certified mail** (so you have proof of delivery). Include:\n\n- Your name, former address, and current address\n- That you vacated on [date]\n- That 30 days have passed with no deposit return or itemization\n- That you demand the full $1,200 returned within 10 days\n- That you are aware of your rights under **Texas Property Code Section 92.109**\n\nKeep a copy. This letter is important evidence if you go to court.\n\n> **Important:** Texas law requires that you give your landlord your **forwarding address** in writing. Did you do this? If yes, great. If not, do it now — it affects your legal standing.\n\n### Step 2: Gather Your Evidence\n- Move-out photos/videos (timestamped if possible)\n- Your lease agreement\n- Proof of your deposit payment\n- Any written communication with your landlord\n- Proof you provided your forwarding address\n\n### Step 3: File in Small Claims Court (Justice Court in Texas)\nIf the landlord doesn't respond to your demand letter, you can sue in **Justice Court** (Texas's small claims court):\n\n- **Filing fee**: roughly $54–$100 depending on the county\n- **Limit**: up to $20,000 — well above your claim\n- **No lawyer required**\n- Find your local Justice Court at **[txcourts.gov](https://www.txcourts.gov)**\n\n---\n\n## Free Help Available to You\n\n- **Texas Law Help**: **[texaslawhelp.org](https://www.texaslawhelp.org)** — free, plain-language guides specifically for Texas tenants, including sample demand letters\n- **Lone Star Legal Aid** or **Texas RioGrande Legal Aid** (depending on your region): free legal help if you qualify by income — find them at **[lawhelp.org/tx](https://www.lawhelp.org/tx)**\n- **State Bar of Texas Lawyer Referral**: **(800) 252-9690** — low-cost initial consultations\n\n---\n\n## Quick Summary of Your Next Steps\n\n| Step | Action |\n|------|--------|\n| ✅ Now | Send certified mail demand letter |\n| ✅ Now | Confirm you've given written forwarding address |\n| ✅ Now | Gather all documentation |\n| ⏳ If no response in 10–14 days | File in Justice Court |\n\n---\n\nOne important question: **Did you provide your landlord with your new address in writing?** This is a key detail under Texas law. If you haven't done it formally, send it along with your demand letter.\n\nWould you like help thinking through what to include in your demand letter?"
