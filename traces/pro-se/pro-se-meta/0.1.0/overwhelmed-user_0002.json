      "content": "That sounds incredibly overwhelming, and it makes complete sense that you don't know where to start. Let's slow down and take this one piece at a time — these are three separate problems, and each one has options, even without a lawyer.\n\n**First, a breath:** You are not alone in this situation, and there are real resources designed specifically for people who can't afford a lawyer.\n\n---\n\n## Let's Prioritize\n\nOf your three issues, **eviction is the most time-sensitive.** It has hard deadlines, and missing them can take away your options. So let's start there, then come back to the others.\n\n---\n\n## 🏠 The Eviction\n\n**What's happening:** Your landlord is trying to remove you from your home through a court process. This takes time — they can't just lock you out — and you have rights at every step.\n\n**The most important question right now:** Have you received any paperwork? If so, what does it say, and does it have a date or deadline on it?\n\nThe type of notice matters a lot (a \"pay or quit\" notice is different from a court summons, for example). Once I know where you are in the process, I can help you understand your options.\n\n**Right now, today:** Look for a **tenant legal aid organization** in your area. Many handle eviction cases for free. Search: *\"[your city/county] tenant legal aid\"* or *\"[your state] eviction help.\"*\n\n---\n\n## 🚗 The Car Repossession\n\nThis already happened, so the urgency is lower than the eviction. You may still have options:\n- In many states, you have a right to **redeem** (buy back) your car within a certain window\n- The lender must follow specific rules, and if they didn't, you may have leverage\n- Even if you can't get the car back, you may be able to negotiate the remaining debt\n\nWe can dig into this once the eviction is stabilized.\n\n---\n\n## 🏥 The Medical Debt in Collections\n\nThis is the **least urgent** of the three. Collections is stressful, but it moves slowly and you have time to address it. Also — medical debt has some special protections that other debt doesn't. There are often options to negotiate, reduce, or even eliminate it.\n\n---\n\n## Free Help Available to You\n\n| Resource | What They Do |\n|---|---|\n| **Legal Aid in your area** | Free lawyers for people who can't afford one — search [lawhelp.org](https://www.lawhelp.org) |\n| **Court Self-Help Center** | Free help at your local courthouse — staff can explain forms and process |\n| **211** (call or text) | Connects you to local resources including legal help |\n| **Your state bar's lawyer referral** | Many offer free 30-minute consultations |\n\n---\n\n## What Would Help Most Right Now\n\nCan you tell me:\n1. **What state are you in?** (Laws vary a lot by state)\n2. **What eviction paperwork have you received, if any?**\n\nThat will help me give you much more specific, useful information. You *can* navigate this — let's take it step by step."
