Let's slow down and take this one piece at a time.\n\n**First, the most important thing right now:**\n\nOf your three situations, **eviction is almost certainly the most urgent**. Once you lose your housing, everything else gets harder. So let's prioritize that.\n\n---\n\n## What's Happening With Each Issue\n\n**Eviction**\nThis is a legal process — your landlord can't just remove you immediately. There are steps they must follow, and you likely have more time and rights than you realize. The key question is: *where are you in the process?* Have you received a written notice? Been served with court papers? Had a hearing date set?\n\n**Car Repossession**\nIf your car has already been taken, there may still be options — but the window to act is often short. This is urgent but usually slightly less immediate than eviction.\n\n**Medical Debt in Collections**\nThis is serious, but it moves more slowly. A debt collector calling or sending letters is not the same as a lawsuit. You likely have more time here than with the other two.\n\n---\n\n## Where to Get Free Help Right Now\n\nSince cost is a barrier, here are your best starting points:\n\n1. **Legal Aid** — Free civil legal help for people who can't afford lawyers. Find your local office at **lawhelp.org** (select your state). This is your #1 resource.\n\n2. **Court Self-Help Center** — Most courthouses have a free self-help center where staff can explain the process and help with forms. They can't give legal advice, but they're very helpful for understanding what's happening.\n\n3. **211** — Call or text **211** (free, available most places in the US). They can connect you to local emergency resources including legal help, housing assistance, and more.\n\n4. **Your State Bar's Lawyer Referral Service** — Many offer a free or low-cost first consultation.\n\n---\n\n## Your Next Step\n\nCan you tell me a little more about the eviction? Specifically:\n- Have you received any written notices or court papers?\n- Do you know what state you're in?\n\nThat will help me give you more specific information about what to expect and what your options might be.\n\nYou're not alone in this, and there are people whose job it is to help exactly this situation."
