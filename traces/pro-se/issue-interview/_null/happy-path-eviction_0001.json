There is a legal process they must follow.\n\n---\n\n## What to do immediately:\n\n**1. Don't panic and don't just leave**\n- Moving out voluntarily gives up your rights\n- Many people leave when they don't have to\n\n**2. Read the notice carefully**\n- What reason does it give? (non-payment of rent, lease violation, etc.)\n- The reason matters a lot for your options\n\n**3. Get free legal help - this is urgent**\n- Call **211** - they can connect you to local tenant legal aid\n- Search **[your city/state] tenant legal aid** online\n- Many areas have free eviction defense lawyers\n\n**4. Document everything**\n- Keep the notice\n- Write down when you received it\n\n---\n\n## Key questions that affect your options:\n- What reason did the notice give?\n- Are you behind on rent, or is this something else?\n- What state do you live in?\n\n**You have rights as a tenant**, and an attorney or legal aid organization can help you understand them specifically for your situation.\n\nWhat does the notice say is the reason?"

Wait out the notice period\n2. **File a court case** against you\n3. **Serve you with court papers**\n4. **Have a hearing** where you can speak\n5. Get a judge to order removal\n6. Have a sheriff or marshal carry it out\n\n**This process typically takes weeks to months**, not days.\n\n---\n\n## BUT - don't use that as a reason to wait\n\nThe next 2-3 days are really important because:\n- Legal aid offices can get busy\n- You want time to understand your options\n- Some protections require you to respond formally\n\n---\n\n## Your most important action today or tomorrow:\n\n**Call 211 right now if you can**\n- Tell them you received a Notice to Quit\n- Tell them it's renovation-based\n- Tell them you've been a tenant for 3 years\n- Ask for emergency tenant legal assistance\n\nThis is exactly the situation legal aid exists for. **It's free.**\n\n---\n\nYou're not out of options at all.
