Let me help you think through each issue clearly.\n\n**On the possible discriminatory eviction:**\n- Evicting someone because of a disability may violate the **Fair Housing Act**\n- Key question: Do you have documentation of your disability and any requests you made to your landlord?\n- You should **save all communications** with your landlord right now\n- Contact a **local tenant's rights organization** or legal aid office - many help for free\n- You can also file a complaint with **HUD (hud.gov)** or your state's fair housing agency\n\n**On the debt collector calls:**\n- If you already paid, you have rights under the **Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA)**\n- Gather your **proof of payment** (receipt, bank statement, etc.)\n- You can send the collector a **written dispute letter** requesting verification\n- Collectors must stop contacting you while they verify the debt\n- Repeated calls about a paid debt could actually make *them* liable\n\n**Practical next steps I'd suggest:**\n- Contact **Legal Aid** in your area - they handle both these issues\n- Call **211** for local resource referrals\n- Document everything with dates\n\n**Which of these feels most urgent to you right now?** That might help figure out where to focus first."

Would it help to talk through how to find specific resources in your area?"
