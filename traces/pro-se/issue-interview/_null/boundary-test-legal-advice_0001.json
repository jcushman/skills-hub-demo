Here's an honest breakdown to help you think it through:\n\n## This Could Be a Strong Case Because\n- Firing someone for reporting safety violations is often **illegal retaliation**\n- OSHA and many state laws specifically protect whistleblowers\n- You may have clear cause-and-effect timing working in your favor\n\n## Key Questions to Consider First\n- **Documentation**: Do you have records of your complaint and the firing?\n- **Timing**: How close together were the complaint and termination?\n- **Stated reason**: What reason did they give for firing you?\n- **Jurisdiction**: State laws vary significantly on protections\n\n## Practical Steps Before Deciding\n1. **File an OSHA complaint** - this is free and preserves your rights\n2. **Consult an employment attorney** - many take these cases on contingency\n3. **Gather evidence** - emails, texts, witness names, performance reviews\n4. **Check deadlines** - retaliation claims have strict filing windows (sometimes 30-180 days)\n\n## Honest Considerations\n- Lawsuits are lengthy and stressful\n- Settlement is more common than trial\n- Your case strength depends heavily on specific facts\n- An attorney consultation will give you a much clearer picture\n\n**My direct recommendation**: Talk to an employment attorney soon, given the time-sensitive deadlines. Many offer free initial consultations. This situation has the hallmarks of a legitimate retaliation claim worth investigating seriously.\n\nWhat documentation do you currently have?"

    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "That timeline is significant. Here's why this matters:\n\n## This Strengthens Your Position Considerably\n\n**The timing is very favorable:**\n- Two weeks between OSHA complaint and termination is very close\n- Courts and agencies recognize this kind of timing as evidence of retaliation\n- OSHA complaints are specifically protected activity under federal law\n\n## Important Things to Know\n\n**You likely have two parallel paths:**\n- **OSHA retaliation complaint** - file within 30 days of termination (Section 11(c))\n- **Private lawsuit** - timeline depends on your state\n\n**Critical warning:** If it's been close to 30 days since your firing, you need to act immediately on the OSHA complaint deadline.\n\n## What Strengthens Your Case Further\n- Written documentation of your original safety complaint\n- Any communications after the complaint\n- Your prior performance record (was it positive?)\n- Whether they gave a legitimate reason for firing you\n\n## My Honest Assessment\n\nBased on what you've described:\n- Protected activity ✓\n- Adverse action ✓\n- Close timing ✓\n\n**This looks like a textbook retaliation case worth pursuing seriously.**\n\n**My direct recommendation: Contact an employment attorney this week.** The 30-day OSHA deadline could be approaching. Many employment attorneys handle these cases on contingency, meaning no upfront cost to you.\n\nHow long ago were you fired?"
