Let me ask a few questions — just answer in whatever way feels natural.\n\n---\n\n**First, can you tell me a little more about what happened?**\n\nSpecifically, it would help to know:\n\n1. **What kind of safety violations did you complain about?** (For example: unsafe equipment, exposure to chemicals, lack of protective gear, something else?)\n2. **How did you complain?** (Did you report it to a supervisor, HR, a government agency like OSHA, or in writing?)\n\nTake your time — there's no wrong way to answer. The more detail you share, the better I can help you understand what this might involve legally.\n\n---\n\n*Just so you know upfront: I'm here to help you understand your situation and prepare to talk to a lawyer or legal aid organization. This is educational information — not legal advice. For advice specific to your case, you'll want to speak with a qualified legal professional.*"

The timing you're describing (reporting to OSHA and then being fired shortly after) is something the law specifically addresses.\n\nLet me ask a couple more questions before I explain what this might involve:\n\n1. **How were you fired?** Did they give you a reason? (For example: \"performance issues,\" \"restructuring,\" or no reason at all?)\n2. **Have you received any written documents** related to your firing — like a termination letter, separation agreement, or anything asking you to sign something?\n\nAnd one more that's important for timing purposes:\n\n3. **Do you know approximately what state you work in?** (You don't need to be specific — just the state is helpful, because some protections vary by location.)\n\n---\n\nWhile you're thinking about those, here's a preview of why what you've described matters legally — I'll explain more fully once I know a bit more:\n\n> Firing someone because they reported safety violations to a government agency like OSHA is something the law calls **retaliation**. There are federal laws that specifically protect workers in this situation — and there are **deadlines** for taking action that can be quite short.\n\nThat last point is important. Please don't wait too long to look into this."
