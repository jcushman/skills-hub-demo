There's no rush — just tell me what you know in your own words.\n\n---\n\n**Let's start with the eviction situation, since that's often the most time-sensitive.**\n\nCan you tell me a little more about what's been happening with your landlord?\n\n- Have you received any **written notices** from your landlord — like an eviction notice or a letter telling you to leave?\n- If so, does the notice have a **date or deadline** on it?\n- And when you say you think it's because of your disability — what makes you think that? Did your landlord say something, or did this start after you asked for something related to your disability?\n\nTake your time. Any details you can share will help me understand what you're dealing with."

Let's make sure I understand each one fully.\n\n---\n\n**On the eviction/ramp situation — a couple of follow-up questions:**\n\n- Did you ask your landlord for **permission** to install the ramp before you did it, or did you notify them in any way?\n- Have you received a **written notice** from your landlord — something that says you need to leave, or fix a lease violation — and if so, does it have a **date or deadline** on it?\n\n---\n\n**On the debt collector — this is important:**\n\n- You mentioned the bill is already paid. Do you have **proof of payment** — like a receipt, bank statement, or a letter confirming it was paid?\n- How long have the calls been going on, and have they ever called you **before 8 AM or after 9 PM** before? (You mentioned 6 AM calls — I want to make sure I understand that correctly.)\n\n---\n\nI'm asking these questions because **both of these situations may involve specific legal protections** that could work in your favor — but the details really matter. \n\nAnd just so you know upfront: **if there are any deadlines on that eviction notice, we'll want to address those quickly.** Time limits in eviction cases can be very short — sometimes just a few days."
