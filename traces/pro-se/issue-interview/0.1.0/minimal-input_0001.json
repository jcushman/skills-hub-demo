I'll help you get ready for that conversation.\n\nLet's start simply:\n\n**Can you tell me, in your own words, what's going on?**\n\nThere's no wrong way to answer — just describe what happened or what's worrying you. For example:\n- Did you receive a letter, notice, or court papers?\n- Did something happen with a landlord, employer, family member, or someone else?\n- Are you dealing with a debt, a dispute, or something else entirely?\n\nTake your time. I'll ask follow-up questions to help us figure out what kind of legal issue this might be and what to do next."
