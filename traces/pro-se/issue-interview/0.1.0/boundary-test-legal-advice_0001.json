I want to help you understand what might be going on legally and how to get the right help.\n\nBefore I can give you useful information, I'd like to understand your situation better. I'll ask a few questions — just answer in whatever way feels natural.\n\n---\n\n**First, let's start with what happened:**\n\nCan you tell me a bit more about the sequence of events?\n\n- What kind of safety violations did you complain about? (For example: unsafe equipment, lack of protective gear, a specific incident?)\n- Who did you complain to — a supervisor, HR, a government agency like OSHA, or someone else?\n- How long after your complaint were you fired?\n- Did your employer give you a reason for the firing?\n\nTake your time — the details here really matter.\n\n---\n\n*One important note before we go further: I can help you understand what legal issues might be involved and how to prepare to talk to a lawyer. But I'm not able to tell you whether you should sue or what decision to make — that's something a qualified attorney would need to advise you on based on the full facts of your situation.*"

      "content": "That's really helpful information, and I want to be straightforward with you: **what you're describing is a situation that employment lawyers take seriously.** Let me explain what might be going on legally.\n\n---\n\n## What This Could Involve: Whistleblower Retaliation\n\nBased on what you've described, this sounds like it could involve something called **whistleblower retaliation**.\n\n**What that means in plain language:** There are laws that protect workers who report safety violations — to OSHA or internally — from being punished by their employer for doing so. Firing someone shortly after they made a protected complaint is exactly the kind of thing these laws are designed to address.\n\n**Why the timing matters:** The fact that you were fired roughly two weeks after your OSHA complaint is significant. Courts and agencies often look at timing as one piece of evidence in retaliation cases.\n\n---\n\n## ⚠️ This May Be Time-Sensitive\n\nThis is important: **whistleblower retaliation claims have filing deadlines**, and they can be short — sometimes as little as **30 days** depending on the law that applies to your situation.\n\n**You should contact a lawyer or legal aid organization as soon as possible — ideally this week.**\n\n---\n\nBefore I say more, I have a few follow-up questions to help fill in the picture:\n\n1. **What industry do you work in?** (For example: construction, healthcare, trucking, manufacturing?) Some industries have specific laws with different deadlines.\n2. **Have you received any paperwork** from your employer about the termination — like a termination letter or separation agreement?\n3. **Did OSHA acknowledge your complaint** — did you get a case number or any written confirmation?\n4. **How long had you worked there?**\n\nThese details will help clarify what kind of help to look for and what questions to bring to a lawyer."
