Let's take it one step at a time so we can figure out what's going on and how to get you the right help.\n\nI want to make sure I understand your situation clearly, so I'm going to ask you a few questions. There's no rush — just tell me what you know.\n\n---\n\n**Let's start with the eviction.**\n\nCan you tell me a little more about what's been happening with your landlord?\n\n- Have you received any written notice — like a letter or a formal document — telling you to leave or that eviction proceedings have started?\n- If so, does it have any dates on it (like a date you're supposed to vacate, or a court date)?\n- And when you say you think it's because of your disability — what makes you feel that way? For example, did your landlord say something, or did this start after you asked for something related to your disability?\n\nTake your time. You don't have to have all the answers — just share what you know."

      "content": "Thank you for sharing that — this is really helpful, and I want you to know that both of these situations involve rights that may protect you. Let's make sure I understand each one fully.\n\n---\n\n**On the eviction and the ramp:**\n\nThis is an important detail. Under a federal law called the **Fair Housing Act**, people with disabilities generally have the right to make **reasonable modifications** to their home — like installing a ramp — even if the lease would otherwise prohibit alterations. If your landlord is trying to evict you *because* you made a modification related to your disability, that could potentially be **disability discrimination**.\n\nI want to understand more before we go further:\n\n- Did you notify your landlord before installing the ramp, or ask for permission?\n- Did your landlord respond in writing at any point — either approving, denying, or complaining about the modification?\n- Have you received a formal eviction notice with a date on it, or has your landlord only spoken to you about this so far?\n\n---\n\n**On the debt collector:**\n\n6 AM calls are a red flag. There's a federal law called the **Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA)** that restricts when and how debt collectors can contact you — and **calls before 8 AM are generally illegal** under that law.\n\nI have a couple of quick questions here too:\n\n- Do you have proof that you already paid the medical bill — like a receipt, bank statement, or a letter confirming payment?\n- Are you keeping any record of these calls (dates, times, what was said)?\n\n---\n\nBoth of these situations may involve **legal protections you're entitled to.** Let's keep going so I can help you understand the full picture and prepare you to get help. What can you tell me about those follow-up questions?"
