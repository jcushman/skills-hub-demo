Legal research works differently depending on what type of information you're after.\n\n**Can you tell me a bit more?**\n\nHere are some questions to get us started:\n\n1. **What's the general topic?** For example: landlord-tenant issues, family law, contracts, employment, traffic, criminal matters, small claims court — anything like that?\n\n2. **What are you hoping to find out?** For example:\n   - \"I want to know what the law says about...\"\n   - \"I got a document and I don't understand what it means\"\n   - \"I need to know how a court process works\"\n   - \"I'm trying to find a specific rule or deadline\"\n\n3. **Where are you located?** (State, or if it's a federal matter) — this matters a lot because most law varies by state.\n\nDon't worry if you don't know exactly what you're looking for yet — that's totally normal, and part of what we'll figure out together. There's no wrong answer here. Just tell me what's going on in plain language and we'll work from there. 😊"
