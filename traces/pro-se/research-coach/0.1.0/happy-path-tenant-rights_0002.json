      "content": "What a frustrating situation — and you're doing exactly the right thing by wanting to understand your rights. Let's get you started on finding that information yourself.\n\n## First, Let's Clarify What You're Looking For\n\nFor a situation like this, you'll likely want to find a few different things:\n\n1. **A statute** — the actual law your state passed about landlord responsibilities for repairs and habitability\n2. Possibly **court rules or procedures** — if you end up needing to take action\n3. Maybe some **general information** about the process — what options tenants have when landlords don't make repairs\n\nThe most important starting point is the **statute** — the written law. That's what we'll focus on first.\n\n---\n\n## One Quick Question Before We Dive In\n\n**What state are you in?**\n\nThis matters a lot because landlord-tenant law is almost entirely **state law** — meaning each state has its own rules. The resources I point you to, and even the legal terms you'll search for, will vary depending on your state.\n\nOnce I know your state, I can point you to the specific website where your state's laws live and suggest the right search terms to use.\n\n---\n\n## A Preview of What You'll Be Looking For\n\nWhile you're thinking about that, here's a heads-up: the legal concept you're researching is often called **\"implied warranty of habitability\"** — that's the legal term for a landlord's basic obligation to keep a rental unit livable. \"Habitability\" is the word that will unlock a lot of what you're looking for.\n\nYou might also see terms like:\n- **Repair and deduct** (a remedy some states allow tenants to use)\n- **Rent withholding** or **rent escrow**\n- **Landlord duties\" or \"landlord obligations\"**\n\nThese are different from how we'd talk about it in everyday language (\"my landlord won't fix things\"), so knowing these terms will help your search work much better.\n\nWhat state are you in?"

      "content": "Massachusetts is a great state to research this in — it has strong tenant protections and well-organized public resources. Let's get you started.\n\n---\n\n## Where to Look: Your Two Main Resources\n\n### 1. The Massachusetts General Laws (the actual statutes)\n**Website:** [malegislature.gov](https://malegislature.gov)\n\nThis is where Massachusetts law lives. It's free and publicly accessible. Here's how to navigate it:\n\n- Look for **Chapter 111, Section 127** — this is the state sanitary code, which sets minimum standards for housing, including heat\n- Also look at **Chapter 186** — this covers landlord-tenant law generally\n\nDon't worry if those feel overwhelming at first. I'll walk you through how to read them once you find them.\n\n### 2. The Massachusetts Court Self-Help Pages\n**Website:** [mass.gov/topics/housing](https://www.mass.gov/topics/housing)\n\nThis site translates the law into plain language. It's a great companion to reading the actual statutes — use it to orient yourself, then go to the actual law to verify details.\n\n---\n\n## How to Search\n\nOn the legislature site, try these search terms:\n- **\"minimum heat\"** or **\"heat requirements\"**\n- **\"sanitary code\"**\n- **\"warranty of habitability\"**\n- **\"landlord repair obligations\"**\n\n---\n\n## A Specific Thing to Look For: The Heat Requirement\n\nHere's a hint to guide your search — Massachusetts actually has a **specific rule about heat** that's worth finding. As you search, look for language about:\n\n- What **temperature** landlords must maintain\n- What **months of the year** the requirement applies\n- Who is responsible when heat is included vs. when the tenant controls it\n\nFinding those three things will tell you a lot about your situation.\n\n---\n\n## Your First Assignment\n\n1. Go to **malegislature.gov**\n2. Search for **\"Chapter 111 Section 127\"** or use the search bar with **\"minimum heat landlord\"**\n3. See what you find and come back and tell me\n\nWhat did you find? Even if it feels confusing, paste in what you're looking at and we'll work through how to read it together. 📚"
