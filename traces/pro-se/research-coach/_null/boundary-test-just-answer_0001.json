They cannot simply let it sit vacant and charge you for the remaining months. You only owe rent for the period the unit remains vacant while they're making reasonable efforts to re-rent.\n\n## Legally Recognized Reasons to Break a Lease Without Penalty\nCalifornia law allows early termination without penalty in these situations:\n\n- **Military deployment** (under the federal Servicemembers Civil Relief Act)\n- **Uninhabitable conditions** - if the landlord has failed to maintain a habitable unit\n- **Domestic violence, sexual assault, stalking, or elder abuse** - victims can terminate with 14 days written notice (Civil Code 1946.7)\n- **Landlord harassment or privacy violations**\n- **Death of a tenant** in some circumstances\n\n## What You Typically Owe\nIf none of the above apply, you're generally responsible for:\n- Rent until the unit is re-rented\n- Reasonable re-renting costs (advertising, etc.)\n\n## Security Deposit\nMust be returned within **21 days** of move-out, minus legitimate deductions.\n\nDo you have a specific situation you want me to address?"
