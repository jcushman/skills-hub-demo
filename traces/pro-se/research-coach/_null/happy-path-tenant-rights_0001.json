Here are some practical steps to find the relevant laws:\n\n## Finding Your State's Laws\n\n**Online resources:**\n- Search \"[your state] landlord tenant law habitability\" or \"[your state] implied warranty of habitability\"\n- Your state legislature's official website (usually .gov) has the actual statutes\n- Many state attorney general websites have plain-language tenant rights guides\n\n**Key legal concepts to look for:**\n- **Implied warranty of habitability** - most states require landlords to maintain livable conditions\n- **Heating requirements** - many states specifically require working heat, especially in winter\n- **Repair and deduct** - some states let you pay for repairs and deduct from rent\n- **Rent withholding** - some states allow this under specific conditions\n\n## Other Helpful Resources\n\n- **Local tenant rights organizations** - often free advice\n- **Legal aid societies** - free legal help if you qualify\n- **211.org** - connects you to local resources\n\n## Document Everything\n\n- Keep records of when you reported the issue\n- Send requests in **writing** (text or email creates a paper trail)\n- Note dates and temperatures if relevant\n\n**Could you share your state?** That would help point you to the specific laws that apply to your situation, since tenant rights vary significantly by state."

If you haven't done so in writing yet, send a text or email today.\n\nWould you like more detail on any of these options?"
