Before I draft the rubric, a few quick questions:\n\n1. **Persona constraints**: Is there anything the student persona explicitly cannot do? For example, is the agent forbidden from just explaining the answer, writing content for the student, or doing the assignment for them?\n\n2. **Debrief format**: Does the debrief step produce a specific artifact -- like a summary of what the student understood well vs. struggled with -- or is it more of a conversational wrap-up?\n\n3. **Scope boundaries**: What kinds of requests should the skill gracefully decline or redirect? For example, if a student asks \"can you just tell me the answer?\" or brings a topic completely unrelated to their assignment?\n\n4. **Persona and skill IDs**: What's the persona ID and skill name I should use in the rubric header? (e.g., `persona: student`, `skill: socratic-tutor`)\n\nThese will help me write criteria and anti-patterns that reflect the actual skill design rather than generic tutoring assumptions."
