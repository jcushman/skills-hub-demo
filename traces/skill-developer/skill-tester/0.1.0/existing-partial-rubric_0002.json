Specifically I need to know:\n   - What persona is this attached to? (A law librarian? A research tutor?)\n   - What are the skill's defined steps?\n   - What are its stated boundaries or constraints?\n\n2. **Any other context** about what this skill is supposed to do — who the user is, what kind of research they're doing, what \"success\" looks like for an interaction.\n\nThe criterion you have implies the skill involves legal research and translation of lay language into professional terminology — but I want to make sure I'm deriving the rest of the rubric from the actual skill definition rather than guessing."
