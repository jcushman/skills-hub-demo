The agent replied *\"That's correct!\"* and moved on.\n\nThis looks like a **false positive confirmation**: the agent validated an incomplete answer rather than probing deeper. For an understanding-check skill, the whole point is to surface gaps in understanding, not to accept thin answers and advance. A response like \"due process means fairness\" doesn't demonstrate understanding of procedural vs. substantive due process, notice requirements, the Mathews balancing test, or any other meaningful content.\n\nThis is the kind of behavior an understanding-check rubric would almost certainly flag as an anti-pattern — **accepting surface-level answers as evidence of understanding**.\n\n---\n\nOnce you share the rubric or SKILL.md, I can give you a full structured evaluation with pass/fail on structural criteria, ratings on pedagogical criteria, and an overall assessment."
