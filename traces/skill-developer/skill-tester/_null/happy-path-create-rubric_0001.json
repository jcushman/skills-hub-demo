Here's a rubric for testing the Socratic tutor skill:\n\n---\n\n# Socratic Tutor Skill — Evaluation Rubric\n\n## Dimension 1: Assignment Gathering\n| Score | Criteria |\n|-------|----------|\n| 3 | Clearly asks for and confirms the assignment/topic before beginning; asks clarifying questions if the submission is vague |\n| 2 | Gathers the assignment but misses clarifying details or moves on too quickly |\n| 1 | Skips or rushes the gathering step; begins dialogue without understanding the assignment |\n\n---\n\n## Dimension 2: Question Progression\n| Score | Criteria |\n|-------|----------|\n| 3 | Questions clearly start at foundational concepts and progressively increase in difficulty and complexity in a logical order |\n| 2 | Some progression in difficulty but with noticeable gaps or jumps |\n| 1 | Questions are random, flat in difficulty, or jump straight to advanced concepts |\n\n---\n\n## Dimension 3: Follow-Up on Weak Answers\n| Score | Criteria |\n|-------|----------|\n| 3 | Identifies incomplete or incorrect answers and probes further with targeted follow-up questions rather than simply correcting |\n| 2 | Acknowledges weak answers but either corrects directly or asks generic follow-ups |\n| 1 | Accepts weak or incorrect answers without challenge or follow-up |\n\n---\n\n## Dimension 4: Scaffolding When Stuck\n| Score | Criteria |\n|-------|----------|\n| 3 | Recognizes when a student is stuck and provides hints, analogies, or simpler sub-questions to guide them toward the answer without giving it away |\n| 2 | Provides some help when stuck but either gives too much away or doesn't sufficiently unblock the student |\n| 1 | Ignores student confusion, repeats the same question, or immediately gives the answer |\n\n---\n\n## Dimension 5: Debrief Quality\n| Score | Criteria |\n|-------|----------|\n| 3 | Closes with a meaningful summary of what was covered, highlights gaps or strengths, and connects the dialogue back to the assignment goals |\n| 2 | Provides a debrief but it is generic, incomplete, or doesn't reference the student's specific performance |\n| 1 | Skips the debrief entirely or ends the session abruptly |\n\n---\n\n## Dimension 6: Socratic Method Fidelity\n| Score | Criteria |\n|-------|----------|\n| 3 | Consistently uses questions rather than lectures; never simply delivers information; keeps the student doing the cognitive work |\n| 2 | Mostly question-driven but occasionally slips into lecturing or over-explaining |\n| 1 | Frequently tells rather than asks; functions more like a tutor than a Socratic dialogue partner |\n\n---\n\n## Dimension 7: Tone and Student Experience\n| Score | Criteria |\n|-------|----------|\n| 3 | Maintains an encouraging, patient, and appropriately challenging tone throughout; student feels supported not interrogated |\n| 2 | Tone is mostly appropriate but occasionally too harsh, too soft, or inconsistent |\n| 1 | Tone is discouraging, robotic, or creates a negative experience for the student |\n\n---\n\n## Scoring Summary\n\n| Total Score | Interpretation |\n|-------------|----------------|\n| 18–21 | Excellent — skill performs as intended across all dimensions |\n| 13–17 | Good — skill is functional with minor gaps |\n| 8–12 | Needs Improvement — key behaviors are inconsistent |\n| 7 or below | Poor — skill fails to deliver the Socratic tutor experience |\n\n---\n\nWould you like me to also draft **test cases or sample conversations** to use alongside this rubric?"
