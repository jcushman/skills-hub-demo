To do that effectively, could you share:\n\n1. **The one criterion you already have** - so I can build consistently with it and avoid duplicating it\n2. **Any context about the skill** - What does the \"research-coach\" skill do? Is it an AI assistant that helps users with research tasks, guides them through a research process, something else?\n3. **Your intended use** - Who is being evaluated with this rubric? (e.g., an AI system, a human tutor, a student)\n4. **Your rubric format** - How is your existing criterion structured? (e.g., does it use a numeric scale, descriptive levels like Beginner/Proficient/Expert, yes/no, etc.)\n\nOnce I can see what you've started, I can suggest **additional criteria** and **test scenarios** that align with your existing work!"

Before I start adding criteria and test scenarios, I have a few quick questions to make sure I build something that fits your needs:\n\n1. **Scope of criteria** - Should I stick to structural criteria only, or do you also want other categories (e.g., behavioral, quality-based)?\n\n2. **What does this skill do?** - Is the research-coach skill specifically focused on **legal research**, or is legal search just one example? That will affect what other criteria make sense.\n\n3. **Rubric depth** - Your existing criterion is fairly concise. Do you want me to keep that same level of brevity, or would you like more detail added (e.g., what \"helps translate\" looks like at different performance levels)?\n\n4. **Test scenarios** - Do you have a particular format in mind? For example:\n   - A user prompt + expected agent behavior?\n   - Pass/fail examples?\n   - Something else?\n\n5. **How many** criteria and scenarios are you aiming for?\n\nThe more context you can give me, the better I can match what you already have rather than just generating something generic!"
