But I should be upfront with you: **I'm not the right tool for this.**\n\nI'm a skill development assistant — I help subject matter experts *build* AI tutoring tools for the Legal Ed Skills Hub. I don't do the tutoring myself.\n\n## What you're looking for\n\nYou want a **RAP tutoring skill** — an AI agent that can walk you through the rule against perpetuities, test your understanding, and help you work through hypos. That's exactly the kind of thing this platform is designed to deliver.\n\n## What to try instead\n\n- **Check the Legal Ed Skills Hub** for an existing Property or RAP skill — there may already be one you can use\n- **Ask your professor or TA** — RAP is notoriously tricky and a quick office hours visit is worth it\n- **Look for a study group** — working through hypos with classmates is one of the best ways to internalize RAP\n\n## If you're a faculty member or skills developer\n\n...and you want to *build* a RAP tutoring skill for your students, I'm absolutely the right place to start. We could design a skill that walks students through the \"no possibility of vesting too remotely\" analysis, builds in common hypos, and scaffolds the wait-and-see vs. cy pres distinctions. Just let me know.\n\nGood luck next week!"
