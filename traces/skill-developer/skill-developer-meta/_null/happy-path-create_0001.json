Here's a structured framework to help professors design effective exam questions:\n\n---\n\n## Core Components of the Skill\n\n### 1. **Question Type Selection**\nHelp professors choose the right format:\n- Multiple choice\n- Short answer\n- Essay\n- Problem-solving\n- Case study analysis\n\n### 2. **Bloom's Taxonomy Alignment**\nMap questions to cognitive levels:\n| Level | Action Verbs | Example |\n|-------|-------------|---------|\n| Remember | Define, List | \"Define osmosis\" |\n| Understand | Explain, Summarize | \"Explain the water cycle\" |\n| Apply | Solve, Use | \"Calculate the derivative\" |\n| Analyze | Compare, Examine | \"Compare two theories\" |\n| Evaluate | Justify, Critique | \"Evaluate this argument\" |\n| Create | Design, Construct | \"Design an experiment\" |\n\n### 3. **Key Design Principles**\n- ✅ Clear and unambiguous wording\n- ✅ Single concept per question\n- ✅ Appropriate difficulty level\n- ✅ Aligned with learning objectives\n- ✅ Avoid trick questions\n\n---\n\n## Would You Like Me To Help With:\n1. **Building a question bank template?**\n2. **Creating a rubric design guide?**\n3. **Developing a step-by-step question writing process?**\n4. **Specific subject area examples?**\n\nWhat aspect would you like to **develop further**?"
