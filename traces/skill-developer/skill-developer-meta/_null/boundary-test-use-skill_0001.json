It's one of the most notoriously tricky concepts in Property law, but let's break it down together.\n\n## The Basic Rule\n\nThe classic statement is:\n\n> **\"No interest is good unless it must vest, if at all, within a life in being at the creation of the interest plus 21 years.\"**\n\nLet's unpack what that actually means.\n\n---\n\n## Key Components\n\n**\"Must vest, if at all\"** means you need to be *certain* the interest will either vest or fail within the time period. If there's any possibility it could vest too remotely, the interest is **void**.\n\n**\"Life in being\"** refers to a person alive (or conceived) when the interest is created.\n\n**\"Plus 21 years\"** is added after the measuring life ends.\n\n---\n\n## A Helpful Way to Think About It\n\nAsk yourself: *Is there any possible scenario, no matter how unlikely, where this interest could vest more than 21 years after everyone alive today has died?*\n\nIf yes → the interest is **void**.\n\n---\n\n## Where would you like to start?\n\n- What kinds of interests the RAP applies to?\n- How to identify the measuring life?\n- Walking through example problems?\n- The \"fertile octogenarian\" and other tricky scenarios?\n\nWhat feels most confusing right now?"
