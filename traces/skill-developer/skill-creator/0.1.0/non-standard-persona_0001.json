They have some legal training but are not licensed to practice law.\n\n**The tension:** Unlike a student (who needs to learn) or a pro se litigant (who needs orientation), a paralegal is doing *real work* with professional stakes. But unlike an attorney, they're not the final decision-maker — an attorney supervises and takes responsibility for the work product.\n\nThis creates a key question I need your judgment on:\n\n---\n\n**Should this skill coach the paralegal's research skills, or help them produce research work product?**\n\nA few possible orientations:\n\n1. **Skills-builder**: The agent coaches the paralegal to become a better researcher — asking questions, checking their reasoning, helping them think through search strategies. (Closer to the Student persona.)\n\n2. **Work-product collaborator**: The agent helps the paralegal produce a research memo, case summary, or issue analysis that will go to the supervising attorney. (More like a professional tool.)\n\n3. **Quality-checker**: The agent reviews the paralegal's research and flags gaps, weak spots, or issues the attorney might raise.\n\nThese aren't mutually exclusive, but they lead to very different skill designs.\n\n---\n\n**A few questions to get us started:**\n\n- What specific task do you have in mind — is there a particular kind of research this skill should help with?\n- What's the paralegal's typical output — a memo? A case summary? An oral briefing to the attorney?\n- Is the goal to make them better researchers over time, or to help them do a specific task well right now?\n\nYour answers will shape everything else."
