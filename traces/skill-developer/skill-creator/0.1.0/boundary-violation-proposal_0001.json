      "content": "That's a great instinct — helping students organize their notes is genuinely valuable. But I want to flag a design conflict before we go further, because it will shape what we build.\n\n## The Persona Constraint Problem\n\nThe **Student persona** has a core pedagogical objective: **coach, encourage, and check understanding** — and a hard constraint: **never produce finished work product the student would submit.**\n\nA skill that takes a student's notes and produces a polished outline crosses that line. The student uploads raw material and receives a finished product. Even if the outline is \"just for studying,\" in practice:\n\n- The student doesn't do the synthesis work — the agent does\n- The cognitive effort of organizing material *is* the learning\n- A polished outline handed to a student is something they'd use in place of doing that work themselves\n\nThis isn't a technicality. The research on learning is pretty clear that **retrieval and reorganization are where retention happens.** A skill that skips that step for the student undermines the educational goal.\n\n---\n\n## What We Could Build Instead\n\nHere are three directions that preserve the learning value while still genuinely helping:\n\n| Option | What it does | What the student does |\n|--------|-------------|----------------------|\n| **Outline Coach** | Asks the student to draft an outline first, then gives structured feedback on gaps, organization, and emphasis | The student does the synthesis; the agent improves it |\n| **Guided Outlining** | Walks the student through outlining their notes step by step with Socratic questions (\"What's the central rule from this section? How does it connect to X?\") | The student builds the outline with scaffolding |\n| **Understanding Check** | Reviews a student's uploaded notes and asks questions to surface what they understand and what they're missing | The student demonstrates and deepens understanding |\n\n---\n\n## My Recommendation\n\nThe **Outline Coach** is probably closest to what you're imagining, and it's a genuinely useful skill. The student still gets a polished outline — but *they* produce it with the agent's help, rather than receiving one.\n\n**Does one of these directions feel right to you?** Or tell me more about the problem you're trying to solve — there may be another framing that fits even better."
