      "content": "What a great skill to build! Case briefing is one of those foundational 1L skills where good coaching early makes a huge difference, and it's exactly the kind of thing an AI agent can reinforce between your workshops.\n\nLet me make sure I understand the context before we start designing this together.\n\n---\n\n## A few questions to get us started\n\n**1. Who's using this skill?**\n\nThis sounds like a **Student** skill — a 1L who's trying to learn how to brief cases. That means the agent's job is to *coach and build understanding*, not to write the brief for them. The agent should never hand over a finished brief the student could just copy. Does that match your intent?\n\n**2. What does \"briefing a case\" look like in your workshops?**\n\nDifferent schools and professors emphasize different formats. Some use IRAC-style briefs, some use FIRAC, some have their own templates. \n\n- Do you teach a specific structure (e.g., Facts, Issue, Rule, Holding, Reasoning, Disposition)?\n- Are there elements you find students consistently get wrong or skip?\n- Do you want the skill to work with *any* case, or is it oriented toward a particular subject (Contracts, Torts, Civil Procedure)?\n\n**3. What's the learning goal beyond \"write a brief\"?**\n\nYour workshops probably have a deeper objective — something like \"students understand *why* each element matters\" or \"students can identify the legally relevant facts vs. irrelevant ones.\" What do you want a student to walk away understanding?\n\n**4. What does a student bring to this interaction?**\n\nWhen someone activates this skill, what do you imagine they have in front of them? A case they've already read? A case they're struggling to understand? A draft brief they want feedback on?\n\n---\n\nTake these in whatever order feels natural — even a few sentences on each will give me enough to start drafting something you can react to."

    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "This is really useful — you've just identified the two hardest things about case briefing for 1Ls:\n\n1. **Holding vs. dicta** — students either can't tell the difference or don't understand why it matters\n2. **Paraphrasing vs. copying** — the temptation to just lift language from the opinion is almost universal\n\nAnd the point about subject-matter adaptation is smart. The *structure* of a brief is fairly consistent, but what counts as a \"relevant fact\" or a \"well-stated issue\" is genuinely different in Torts vs. Con Law vs. Civ Pro.\n\nLet me ask a few more focused questions before I draft, because your answers will shape the actual step-by-step instructions the agent follows.\n\n---\n\n## Digging into the pedagogy\n\n**On holding vs. dicta:**\n\nWhen you teach this in your workshops, how do you help students find the holding? Do you use a particular test or framing — like \"what did the court *have* to decide to resolve this dispute?\" or \"what would change if you removed this sentence?\" I want the agent to use your approach, not a generic one.\n\n**On paraphrasing:**\n\nWhen a student submits a brief that's mostly copied language, what do you say to them? Do you ask them to explain it back to you? Have them cover the case and restate it? I want to build that intervention into the skill.\n\n**On subject-matter adaptation:**\n\nWhat information would the agent need to adapt well? Just knowing the course name (Torts, Con Law, etc.)? Or does it also matter what *unit* they're in, or who their professor is? \n\nFor example — would a Con Law brief in a federalism unit look different from one in a First Amendment unit? Or is the course-level distinction enough?\n\n**On where students start:**\n\nWhen a student activates this skill, do you picture them:\n- (A) Having read the case and trying to write a brief from scratch\n- (B) Having a draft brief they want feedback on\n- (C) Confused mid-reading and not sure what the case is even about\n\nOr all three? The agent's opening move depends on this.\n\n---\n\nYou don't need to answer exhaustively — even rough answers will let me start drafting something concrete for you to react to."
