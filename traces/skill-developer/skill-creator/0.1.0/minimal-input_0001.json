Let's figure out what you're actually trying to build.\n\nA few questions to help us get oriented:\n\n**1. Who are you thinking about?**\nIs there a particular person or role in mind — a law student, a professor designing a course, someone representing themselves in court, a practicing attorney? Or maybe someone else entirely?\n\n**2. What's the frustration or gap?**\nIs there something you've noticed people struggling with, or a task that feels like it *should* have better support? Even something like \"students always get stuck on X\" or \"I keep having to explain Y over and over\" is a useful starting point.\n\n**3. Any sparks?**\nSometimes people come in with a half-formed idea — \"something about oral argument\" or \"helping people understand contracts\" or \"I want students to actually think instead of just getting answers.\" Does anything like that resonate?\n\nYou don't need to have answers to all of these. Even one thread is enough to pull on. What's on your mind?"
