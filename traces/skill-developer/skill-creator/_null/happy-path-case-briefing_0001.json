Let me help you think through how to build this effectively.\n\n## Key Questions to Shape the Skill\n\nBefore diving in, it would help to clarify a few things:\n\n**About your goals:**\n- Do you want the skill to *teach* the concept, *practice* it interactively, or **both**?\n- Should it walk students through a real case, or use a simplified example?\n- Do you want it to assess their work or just guide them?\n\n**About the format:**\n- Is this a **voice skill** (Alexa-style) or a **text-based interactive tool**?\n- Will students use it independently or alongside your workshop?\n\n---\n\n## Core Components I'd Suggest Including\n\nA strong case briefing skill would likely cover:\n\n1. **What a case brief is and why it matters**\n2. **The standard components** (IRAC or FIRAC structure)\n - Facts\n - Issue\n - Rule/Holding\n - Analysis/Reasoning\n - Conclusion/Disposition\n3. **A worked example** with a real or sample case\n4. **Practice opportunities** with feedback\n5. **Common mistakes** 1Ls make\n\n---\n\n**Where would you like to start?** I can help you outline content, draft instructional text, design practice exercises, or structure the whole skill from scratch."

      "content": "# Refining the Case Briefing Skill\n\nThese are really sharp pedagogical priorities. Let me reflect them back and build on them.\n\n## Your Two Core Teaching Challenges\n\n### 1. Holding vs. Dicta\nThis is genuinely hard for 1Ls because:\n- Courts don't label things \"this is the holding\"\n- Dicta can *sound* authoritative and important\n- Students often copy the most quotable language, which is frequently dicta\n- The distinction matters enormously for how precedent works\n\n### 2. Copying vs. Paraphrasing\nThis is a real habit problem because:\n- Legal language feels precise and \"safe\" to reproduce\n- Students worry they'll get it wrong if they rephrase\n- It masks whether they actually understood the case\n- It becomes a problem in practice too, not just school\n\n### 3. Course-Specific Adaptation *(your third insight)*\nThis is sophisticated and often overlooked. For example:\n\n| Component | Torts | Con Law | Contracts | Civ Pro |\n|-----------|-------|---------|-----------|---------|\n| **Facts** | Who did what to whom, damages | Parties, government action | Offer, acceptance, consideration | Jurisdiction, procedural history |\n| **Issue** | Duty, breach, causation, harm | Constitutional provision at stake | Formation, performance, breach | Procedural question |\n| **Rule** | Elements of the tort | Constitutional test/standard | Contract doctrine | Procedural rule |\n| **Special focus** | Policy rationale | Level of scrutiny | Remedies | What the court could/couldn't do |\n\n---\n\n## Questions to Sharpen the Design\n\n**On holding vs. dicta:**\n- Do you want the skill to explicitly flag dicta in example cases and explain *why* it's dicta?\n- Should students have to *identify* the holding themselves before getting feedback?\n\n**On paraphrasing:**\n- Should the skill show a \"bad brief\" (copied language) vs. \"good brief\" (paraphrased) comparison?\n- Would a checklist help — e.g., *\"Could you explain this sentence to a classmate without looking at the case?\"*\n\n**On course adaptation:**\n- Would students select their course at the start?\n- Do you have specific cases in mind for each course, or would you want the skill to work with cases professors actually assign?\n\n---\n\n## A Possible Skill Structure\n\n```\nSTART\n  └── Student selects course (Torts, Contracts, Con Law, Civ Pro, etc.)\n        └── Skill explains what matters most in THIS course's briefs\n              └── Student reads a sample case (or inputs their assigned case)\n                    └── Guided prompts for each brief section\n                          └── Holding vs. dicta exercise\n                                └── Paraphrase check\n                                      └── Feedback + model brief comparison\n```\n\n---\n\nWhat feels most important to nail down first — the **content and examples**, the **interactive structure**, or the **feedback mechanisms**?"
