However, that's exactly the kind of situation where **creating a custom skill** makes sense!\n\nTo help build a great paralegal legal research skill, it would be helpful to think through a few things:\n\n## Key Questions to Define the Skill\n\n**About the Work**\n- What types of legal research do they most commonly do? (case law, statutes, regulations, etc.)\n- What jurisdiction(s) are they typically working in?\n- What practice areas? (litigation, corporate, family law, etc.)\n\n**About the Output**\n- What does a good research result look like for them?\n- Do they need formatted memos, summaries, citations?\n- What citation format? (Bluebook, etc.)\n\n**About the Workflow**\n- Are they working from attorney instructions?\n- Do they need to flag issues or just find answers?\n- What databases do they typically use? (Westlaw, LexisNexis, etc.)\n\n## What I Can Help You Build\n\n- A **persona description** for the paralegal\n- **Specific prompts** for common research tasks\n- **Output templates** for research memos\n- **Guardrails** to keep responses appropriate (e.g., not giving legal advice)\n\nWould you like to start by describing the **specific type of paralegal** you have in mind, or do you have a particular research task you want the skill to handle first?"
