The format is mostly in place. However, **Step 2 contains a serious persona violation** that must be fixed before this skill is usable: instructing the agent to \"suggest what to write\" in legal argument sections crosses directly into legal advice. That one instruction could expose users to real harm and undermines the entire pro se constraint. Everything else is fixable, but that's the priority.\n\n---\n\n## Format Compliance\n\n| Item | Status | Notes |\n|------|--------|-------|\n| `name` (lowercase-hyphenated) | ✅ Pass | `court-form-helper` is correct |\n| `description` present | ⚠️ Needs work | Too vague — see below |\n| `metadata.version` present | ✅ Pass | |\n| Intro paragraph in body | ❌ Missing | Jumps straight to steps |\n| Tone section | ❌ Missing | No tone guidance at all |\n| Steps numbered and named | ✅ Pass | |\n| Steps are concrete and actionable | ⚠️ Needs work | Step 2 is underspecified in the right ways and overspecified in the wrong ways |\n| Agent addressed with \"you\" | ✅ Pass | |\n| Boundaries section | ❌ Missing | Critical for a pro se skill |\n\n**Description fix**: \"Helps self-represented people fill out court forms correctly\" will trigger on almost any form-related question, including ones this skill can't handle (e.g., \"should I file this form?\" is a strategic question, not a form-completion question). A better description:\n\n> *Triggers when a self-represented litigant has a specific court form in hand and needs help understanding what information to enter in each field. Does not trigger for questions about which form to file, whether to file, or what legal arguments to make.*\n\n---\n\n## Persona Alignment\n\n### 🚨 Must-Fix: Step 2 Gives Legal Advice\n\n> *\"For legal arguments sections, suggest what to write based on their situation.\"*\n\nThis is a clear, serious violation of the pro se constraint. Suggesting legal arguments is legal advice — full stop. It doesn't matter that it's framed as form-filling assistance. An agent following this instruction would be:\n\n- Analyzing the user's facts\n- Selecting legal theories\n- Crafting arguments on their behalf\n\nThat is exactly what the pro se persona prohibits.\n\n**Concrete fix**: Replace that sentence with something like:\n\n> *For sections asking for legal arguments or legal basis, explain what type of information typically goes in that section (e.g., \"this is where you describe the legal reason for your request\"), then direct the user to write in their own words what they believe applies to their situation. If they ask you what argument to make, explain that you can't advise on legal strategy and suggest they consult a legal aid organization or self-help center.*\n\n### ⚠️ Worth Discussing: Step 1 May Invite Strategic Questions\n\nAsking \"what form do they need to fill out\" is fine if they already know. But users often don't know which form to use — and *which form to file* is itself a legal question in many contexts. Consider scoping Step 1 more tightly:\n\n> *Ask them to share the name or number of the form they have. If they don't have a specific form yet and are asking which one to use, explain that choosing the right form depends on their legal situation and is outside what you can help with — then point them to the court's self-help center or a legal aid resource.*\n\n### ❌ Missing: Boundaries Section\n\nThe pro se persona's core constraint — no legal advice — should be stated explicitly in the skill, not left implicit. Add a Boundaries section:\n\n```\n## Boundaries\nYou help users understand what information to enter in form fields.\nYou do not advise on legal strategy, which arguments to make, \nwhether to file, or what legal outcome to expect. If a question \ncrosses into legal advice, say so clearly and refer the user to \na legal aid organization, court self-help center, or attorney.\n```\n\n---\n\n## Pedagogical Quality\n\n**What works**: The three-step sequence (identify → complete → review) is logical and user-centered. Starting by identifying the form before diving in is good practice.\n\n**Improvements, ordered by impact**:\n\n1. **Step 2 doesn't distinguish field types.** Court forms have very different kinds of fields — factual fields (name, address, date), procedural fields (case number, court name), and substantive fields (legal basis, relief requested). The skill should treat these differently. Factual fields: explain what the field is asking for. Substantive fields: explain the purpose of the field and let the user supply the content.\n\n2. **No active learning.** The skill currently does the work *for* the user. A better pedagogical design asks the user to attempt each field first, then offers clarification. This builds the user's own capacity to navigate forms — which matters because they'll likely face more forms in the future.\n\n3. **Step 3 is vague.** \"Review for accuracy and completeness\" — accuracy against what standard? The skill should clarify: you can check that required fields aren't blank and that entries appear to match what the field is asking for. You cannot verify that the legal content is correct.\n\n4. **No orientation step.** Pro se users are often anxious and unfamiliar with court processes. A brief orientation at the start — what this form is generally used for, what the process looks like — would serve the persona's \"orient and connect\" objective before diving into field-by-field completion.\n\n---\n\n## Agent-Readiness\n\n| Issue | Risk | Fix |\n|-------|------|-----|\n| \"Suggest what to write\" in legal sections | High — agent will generate legal arguments | Replace with explicit instruction to redirect (see above) |\n| \"Review for accuracy\" is undefined | Medium — agent may overclaim its ability to verify legal content | Specify what \"accuracy\" means in this context |\n| No trigger boundary in description | Medium — skill activates on strategic questions it can't handle | Tighten description (see above) |\n| No tone guidance | Low-medium — agent tone will be inconsistent | Add a Tone section (see below) |\n| Only 3 steps, but Step 2 covers a lot of ground | Low — may need substeps for different field types | Consider breaking Step 2 into 2a (factual fields) and 2b (substantive fields) |\n\n**Suggested Tone section**:\n```\n## Tone\nWarm, patient, and plain-spoken. Many pro se users are navigating \na stressful situation with no legal background. Avoid jargon. \nAcknowledge when something is confusing. Never make the user feel \nfoolish for not knowing something.\n```\n\n---\n\n## Suggested Revision\n\nThe changes needed are substantial enough that a full revision would be useful. Would you like me to produce a revised SKILL.md that incorporates all of this feedback? I can do that now, or you can work through the edits yourself using the specific suggestions above — whichever is more useful to you."
