      "content": "This is a solid starting point — the structure is right, the persona is appropriate, and the core intent is clear. But there are some meaningful gaps that would cause an AI agent to behave inconsistently or too permissively. Here's the full review.\n\n---\n\n## Summary\n\nThe skill has the right bones: correct frontmatter format, a logical three-step sequence, and an appropriate student persona. The most important thing to fix is **Step 2**, which is so vague that different agents would interpret it completely differently — some might rewrite the student's draft wholesale, which would violate the student persona's core constraint. The description also needs to be more specific to trigger reliably on the right tasks.\n\n---\n\n## Format Compliance\n\n| Item | Status | Note |\n|------|--------|------|\n| `name` (lowercase-hyphenated) | ✅ Pass | `writing-feedback` is clean |\n| `description` trigger paragraph | ⚠️ Needs work | \"Helps with legal writing\" is too broad — see below |\n| `metadata.version` | ✅ Pass | Present |\n| Intro paragraph | ✅ Pass | Brief but present |\n| Tone section | ✅ Pass | Present, though thin — see Pedagogical Quality |\n| Numbered, named steps | ✅ Pass | Steps are numbered and named |\n| Agent addressed as \"you\" | ✅ Pass | \"You help law students...\" |\n| Boundaries section | ❌ Missing | Critical for a student skill — see Persona Alignment |\n\n---\n\n## Persona Alignment\n\n**Severity: Must-Fix**\n\nThe skill has no explicit Boundaries section, which means the student persona's core constraint — *never produce finished work product the student would submit* — is never stated. This is a significant risk. Step 2 says \"giving feedback,\" which sounds safe, but an agent following this skill could reasonably interpret \"help the student improve their writing\" as license to rewrite sentences, restructure paragraphs, or produce a corrected version of the draft. That's work product.\n\n**Specific risk:** The phrase *\"help the student improve their writing by giving feedback\"* is ambiguous. \"Help improve\" could mean coaching or it could mean editing. An agent won't know the difference unless you tell it.\n\n**Fix:** Add an explicit Boundaries section, something like:\n\n```\n## Boundaries\nYou coach the student — you do not edit or rewrite their work. \nDo not produce revised sentences, corrected paragraphs, or \na \"fixed\" version of any portion of the draft. Your feedback \nshould describe what to improve and why; the student does the \nrevising.\n```\n\n---\n\n## Pedagogical Quality\n\n### Strengths\n- The three-step sequence (read → feedback → next steps) is a logical and appropriate arc.\n- Ending with next steps is a nice pedagogical touch — it keeps the student oriented and moving forward.\n\n### Issues, Ordered by Impact\n\n**1. Step 2 is too vague to produce consistent behavior** *(High impact)*\n\n\"Give feedback on structure, analysis, and clarity\" tells an agent *what categories* to address but not *how* to give feedback in a pedagogically sound way. Two agents following this instruction would produce very different results — one might write a bullet list of corrections, another might ask the student questions, another might lecture.\n\nGood legal writing feedback for a student should prompt reflection, not just deliver verdicts. Consider specifying the approach:\n\n```\n## Step 2: Give Feedback\nFor each area (structure, analysis, clarity), identify one or two \nspecific passages that illustrate the issue. Explain *why* it's \na problem — what effect does it have on the reader or the argument? \nThen ask the student what they were trying to accomplish in that \npassage before suggesting a direction for revision.\n```\n\n**2. Step 1 doesn't gather context** *(Medium impact)*\n\nThe skill jumps straight to reading the draft without asking the student anything about it. What's the assignment? What audience is the student writing for? What has the professor emphasized? What does the student think is working or not working? Without this, feedback will be generic.\n\nConsider adding a context-gathering step before reading:\n\n```\n## Step 1: Gather Context\nBefore reading the draft, ask the student:\n- What is the assignment and who is the audience?\n- What feedback are they most hoping to get?\n- Is there anything specific they're uncertain about?\n```\n\nThen make the current Step 1 into Step 2.\n\n**3. Tone section is thin** *(Lower impact)*\n\n\"Encouraging and constructive\" is a start, but it doesn't give an agent much to work with. What does encouraging look like when a draft has serious problems? Should the agent name strengths before problems? Should it avoid softening feedback to the point of obscuring it?\n\nA small addition helps:\n\n```\n## Tone\nEncouraging and constructive. Name what's working before identifying \nproblems. Be honest about significant issues — don't soften feedback \nso much that the student misses the point. Frame problems as \nopportunities, not failures.\n```\n\n---\n\n## Agent-Readiness\n\n**1. Description will trigger too broadly** *(Must-fix)*\n\n\"Helps with legal writing\" would activate on almost any writing-related request — drafting a memo, editing a cover letter, explaining citation format. The description needs to specify the trigger scenario more precisely:\n\n```\ndescription: Triggers when a law student shares a draft of legal \nwriting and asks for feedback, coaching, or help improving it. \nDoes not trigger for general writing questions or requests to \ndraft new documents.\n```\n\n**2. No scope limits on draft length or type** *(Worth discussing)*\n\nThe skill doesn't specify what kinds of drafts it handles. A first-year memo and a law review article are very different feedback contexts. You may want to either scope the skill narrowly or add a step that asks what type of document it is and calibrates accordingly.\n\n**3. Step 3 is testable but vague** *(Minor)*\n\n\"Suggest what the student should work on next\" is reasonable, but \"next steps\" could mean anything from \"revise paragraph 3\" to \"read a style guide.\" Consider specifying that next steps should be concrete and prioritized — one or two things, not a laundry list.\n\n---\n\n## Suggested Revision\n\nThe changes here are substantial enough that a revised draft would be useful. Want me to produce a full revised SKILL.md incorporating this feedback? I can show it alongside the original so you can see exactly what changed and decide what to keep."
