The options are:\n   - **Professor** (helps design learning experiences)\n   - **Student** (coaches and checks understanding)\n   - **Pro Se** (orients and connects self-represented litigants)\n   - **CLE** (builds practicing attorneys' skills)\n\n   (If the persona is clear from the skill's content, I can infer it — but it helps to confirm.)\n\nOnce I have the full text, I'll review it across four dimensions: format compliance, persona alignment, pedagogical quality, and agent-readiness, and give you specific, actionable feedback."
