(Professor, Student, Pro Se, or CLE) If it's clear from the skill's content, I can infer it, but it helps to know upfront.\n\nOnce I have those, I'll evaluate the skill across format compliance, persona alignment, pedagogical quality, and agent-readiness, and give you specific, actionable feedback."
