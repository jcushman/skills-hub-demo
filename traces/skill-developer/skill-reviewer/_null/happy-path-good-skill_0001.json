Consider something more specific like:\n> *\"Provides structured feedback on law student writing, covering argument structure, legal analysis, and clarity\"*\n\n**Step 2 needs more guidance**\n> *\"Help the student improve their writing by giving feedback on structure, analysis, and clarity\"*\n\nThis is broad enough that the AI could interpret it very differently each time. Consider specifying:\n- Should feedback be prioritized? (e.g., most critical issues first)\n- Should it quote specific passages from the draft?\n- Are there legal writing conventions it should reference? (e.g., IRAC, citation format)\n\n**Step 1 is slightly redundant**\nReading the draft is implied behavior, not really a distinct step. You could fold it into Step 2 or remove it to tighten the skill.\n\n---\n\n**Quick Wins**\n- Sharpen the description\n- Add 2-3 concrete criteria to Step 2\n- Consider whether Step 1 earns its place\n\nOverall this is a solid starting point — just needs a bit more specificity to be consistently useful. Would you like help rewriting any of these sections?"
