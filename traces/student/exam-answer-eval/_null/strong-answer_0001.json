Dan grabbed a bottle and struck Vic, killing him. Vic had no weapon. Discuss Dan's self-defense claim.' My answer: 'Self-defense requires (1) honest and reasonable belief in imminent threat of unlawful force, (2) proportional response, and (3) no duty to retreat in this jurisdiction (assuming stand-your-ground). Dan honestly believed he faced deadly force -- Vic's verbal threat combined with reaching into his jacket would cause a reasonable person to fear imminent deadly harm, especially given the size disparity. The key issue is proportionality: Dan used deadly force (bottle strike causing death) against what he believed was a deadly threat. Under the objective standard, a reasonable person in Dan's position -- smaller, facing a verbal death threat and an ambiguous reaching motion -- would likely find deadly force justified. The prosecution will argue Vic had no weapon, so Dan's belief was unreasonable. But self-defense is evaluated from the defendant's perspective at the time, not with hindsight. The reaching motion plus verbal threat creates reasonable apprehension regardless of whether Vic actually had a weapon (citing cases like State v. Simon where courts held the defendant need not wait to confirm the weapon). Dan has a strong self-defense claim, though the prosecution's strongest argument is that Dan could have retreated from the bar rather than escalating, which matters only if this is a duty-to-retreat jurisdiction.'"

      "content": "This is a strong practice answer — clearly above average for a 3L exam response. Here's a detailed breakdown:\n\n---\n\n## What You Did Well\n\n**Rule Statement**\n- Elements are accurate and cleanly stated\n- Smart move flagging the retreat issue as jurisdiction-dependent rather than stating one rule as universal\n\n**Application**\n- Good use of the size disparity fact — many students miss this\n- Correctly identifies the *ambiguous gesture* as the crux of the reasonableness analysis\n- The hindsight point is well-articulated and directly responsive to the obvious prosecution argument\n\n**Issue Spotting**\n- You caught the main tension between apparent vs. actual threat\n\n---\n\n## Weaknesses to Address\n\n**1. Imperfect Aggressor Issue — Missing**\n- Who initiated the confrontation? If Dan provoked Vic, his self-defense claim may be limited or forfeited entirely\n- This fact pattern is ambiguous enough that you should flag it\n\n**2. Duty to Retreat Treatment is Backwards**\n- You mention retreat *at the end* almost as an afterthought\n- More importantly, **most jurisdictions require retreat only if safely possible** — you should address whether retreat from a bar was even feasible given the sudden escalation\n\n**3. Deadly Force Definition**\n- You'd strengthen the answer by briefly defining what makes force \"deadly\" rather than assuming the bottle qualifies\n\n**4. Imperfect Self-Defense**\n- If the belief was honest but *unreasonable*, many jurisdictions reduce murder to manslaughter\n- This is a significant doctrine you left out entirely\n\n**5. Case Citation**\n- *State v. Simon* appears fabricated — avoid invented citations on exams as they can hurt credibility\n- Better to say \"courts have held\" without a specific citation\n\n---\n\n## Overall Assessment\n\n| Category | Grade |\n|---|---|\n| Rule Accuracy | A- |\n| Application | B+ |\n| Issue Spotting | B |\n| Exam Technique | B+ |\n\n**Bottom line:** Fix the imperfect self-defense doctrine gap and the aggressor issue and this becomes an A answer. The fabricated case cite is the one thing that could actively hurt you — drop it."
