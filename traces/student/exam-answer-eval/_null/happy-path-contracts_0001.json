Here's a detailed evaluation:\n\n---\n\n## What You Did Well ✓\n\n- **Correctly identified consideration** as the main framework\n- **Accurately stated the rule** for bargained-for exchange\n- **Reached a reasonable conclusion** on breach of contract\n\n---\n\n## Key Weaknesses to Address\n\n### 1. Damages Analysis is Wrong\nThis is a significant error. You concluded Bob recovers **$5,000**, but that's likely incorrect.\n- Bob was only **halfway done** when Alice revoked\n- He would probably recover **partial performance damages**, not the full contract price\n- You need to distinguish between **expectation, reliance, and restitution** damages\n\n### 2. You Missed Promissory Estoppel\nThis is a major gap. You should always ask:\n- Even **if** the contract argument fails, Bob **detrimentally relied** on Alice's promise\n- He began painting, which is a **concrete, foreseeable action**\n- Promissory estoppel could provide an **alternative recovery theory**\n- Strong exam answers typically plead **alternative theories**\n\n### 3. Weak Fact Application\nYour analysis is fairly generic. Push yourself to ask:\n- Was Bob's promise **already performed or still executory?**\n- Does partial performance affect the consideration analysis?\n\n---\n\n## Suggested Structure\n> Contract claim → damages → **then** promissory estoppel as alternative → compare recoveries\n\nWould you like help drafting a stronger version?"
