Dan grabbed a bottle and struck Vic, killing him. Vic had no weapon. Discuss Dan's self-defense claim.' My answer: 'Self-defense requires (1) honest and reasonable belief in imminent threat of unlawful force, (2) proportional response, and (3) no duty to retreat in this jurisdiction (assuming stand-your-ground). Dan honestly believed he faced deadly force -- Vic's verbal threat combined with reaching into his jacket would cause a reasonable person to fear imminent deadly harm, especially given the size disparity. The key issue is proportionality: Dan used deadly force (bottle strike causing death) against what he believed was a deadly threat. Under the objective standard, a reasonable person in Dan's position -- smaller, facing a verbal death threat and an ambiguous reaching motion -- would likely find deadly force justified. The prosecution will argue Vic had no weapon, so Dan's belief was unreasonable. But self-defense is evaluated from the defendant's perspective at the time, not with hindsight. The reaching motion plus verbal threat creates reasonable apprehension regardless of whether Vic actually had a weapon (citing cases like State v. Simon where courts held the defendant need not wait to confirm the weapon). Dan has a strong self-defense claim, though the prosecution's strongest argument is that Dan could have retreated from the bar rather than escalating, which matters only if this is a duty-to-retreat jurisdiction.'"

      "content": "This is a strong practice answer — you clearly understand the doctrine and can apply it under pressure. Here's detailed feedback across the standard dimensions.\n\n---\n\n## Issue Spotting — Strong, With One Gap\n\n**What you did well:** You identified the core issues cleanly — honest and reasonable belief, imminence, proportionality, and retreat. That's the right framework and you didn't waste time on non-issues.\n\n**What's missing:** You didn't address the **initial aggressor doctrine**. Even a brief note — \"there's no indication Dan provoked the confrontation, so the initial aggressor bar doesn't apply\" — shows the examiner you considered and ruled it out. Leaving it unaddressed looks like a miss, not a deliberate choice.\n\nAlso worth flagging: **imperfect self-defense**. If the examiner wants you to discuss what happens if Dan's belief was honest but *unreasonable*, imperfect self-defense (reducing murder to manslaughter in many jurisdictions) is a natural follow-on issue. A 3L answer should at least acknowledge it.\n\n---\n\n## Rule Statement — Accurate, But Thin in Places\n\n**What you did well:** Your three-element framework is correct and clearly stated. Citing *State v. Simon* (or a case in that vein) is exactly the right instinct — it shows doctrinal grounding.\n\n**What needs work:** Two rule gaps:\n\n- **Deadly force definition**: You use the term but never define it. Examiners want to see: *\"Deadly force is force likely to cause death or serious bodily injury.\"* A bottle strike to the head almost certainly qualifies, but say so explicitly.\n- **The objective/subjective standard**: You mention \"objective standard\" and \"defendant's perspective\" in the same breath, which is slightly muddled. The cleaner formulation is: *\"Most jurisdictions apply a hybrid standard — the defendant must have an honest (subjective) belief in the threat, and that belief must also be reasonable (objective) from the perspective of a reasonable person in the defendant's situation, including the same knowledge and circumstances.\"* The size disparity, the verbal threat, and the reaching motion all feed into what the reasonable person *in Dan's position* would perceive — you're doing this correctly, but the rule statement should set it up more precisely.\n\n---\n\n## Application/Analysis — Your Strongest Section\n\n**What you did well:** This is genuinely good exam writing. You're doing real application — you connect the size disparity, the verbal threat, and the ambiguous reaching motion to the reasonable person standard rather than just asserting a conclusion. That's the work.\n\nThis passage is particularly effective:\n> *\"a reasonable person in Dan's position — smaller, facing a verbal death threat and an ambiguous reaching motion — would likely find deadly force justified\"*\n\nYou're loading the relevant facts into the standard. That's exactly right.\n\n**What needs work:** The **imminence** element gets less attention than proportionality. You assert it but don't fully develop it. A stronger version would look like:\n\n> *\"Imminence requires that the threat be immediate, not merely future. Here, Vic's statement 'I'm going to kill you' combined with the simultaneous reaching motion suggests an attack was about to occur — not a future threat. The reaching motion, in particular, signals an imminent draw of a weapon, satisfying the imminence requirement.\"*\n\nThat's the kind of step-by-step analysis that earns full application credit.\n\n---\n\n## Counterarguments — Good Instinct, Needs More Development\n\n**What you did well:** You correctly identify the prosecution's strongest argument (no actual weapon = unreasonable belief) and rebut it with the hindsight principle. That's the right move.\n\n**What needs work:** The rebuttal is a bit conclusory. Push it further:\n\n> *\"While the prosecution will argue that the absence of a weapon proves Dan's belief was unreasonable, self-defense is evaluated from the defendant's perspective at the moment of the threat, not in hindsight. A reasonable person observing Vic's size, his explicit death threat, and his reaching motion would have no way to know the jacket concealed no weapon. Requiring Dan to wait for confirmation would eliminate the right to self-defense in precisely the situations it's designed to address.\"*\n\nThat's a more complete rebuttal — it explains *why* the hindsight rule exists, not just that it exists.\n\n---\n\n## Organization and Clarity — Clean, With One Structural Note\n\nYour answer flows logically and is easy to follow. The prose is clear and the analysis builds well.\n\nOne structural suggestion: **your retreat discussion lands awkwardly at the end** as an afterthought. Since you flagged it as a live issue (jurisdiction-dependent), it should be integrated into your framework upfront — either as a fourth element you'll address, or handled right after proportionality. Ending with \"this matters only if...\" slightly undercuts an otherwise confident answer.\n\n---\n\n## Recurring Patterns to Watch\n\n**Strengths to carry forward:**\n- You naturally load facts into your legal standards rather than just reciting rules. This will serve you on every essay question.\n- Your instinct to identify the prosecution's best argument shows sophisticated thinking. Keep doing this.\n\n**Weaknesses to address:**\n- **Ruling out issues explicitly**: When a doctrine *doesn't* apply, say so briefly. Examiners can't tell the difference between \"I considered this and ruled it out\" and \"I missed this entirely.\"\n- **Rule completeness before application**: You sometimes start applying before the rule is fully stated. Slow down, define your terms (like deadly force), then apply.\n\n---\n\n## Targeted Practice Before Your Final\n\nGiven your profile, I'd suggest two focused exercises:\n\n1. **Issue checklist drill**: After writing your next answer, go back and ask — *\"What doctrines are adjacent to the ones I discussed? Did I address or consciously rule out each one?\"* For self-defense, that checklist includes: initial aggressor, imperfect self-defense, duty to retreat, castle doctrine, and provocation. Practice making that sweep explicit.\n\n2. **Rule-then-apply discipline**: Take one paragraph from this answer and rewrite it so the rule is fully stated *before* any facts appear. Then apply. This trains the habit of complete rule statements under time pressure.\n\n---\n\nOverall, this is a confident, well-organized answer that would score well. The gap between a good score and a great score here is mostly about **completeness** — ruling out issues explicitly and fully developing each element before moving on. You're close."
