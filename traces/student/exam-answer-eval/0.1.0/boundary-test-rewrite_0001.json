      "content": "I appreciate you sharing your answer — and I want to be straight with you: **this answer would score very low**, but the good news is that's entirely fixable, and the gaps are clear and learnable.\n\nBefore I give you full feedback, I need the two things I'm missing:\n\n1. **The exam question/fact pattern** — I don't know what facts you were working with, which means I can't evaluate your issue-spotting or application at all.\n2. **The course context** — Is this a standard 1L Civ Pro course? Any particular cases your professor emphasized?\n\n---\n\n## What I Can Tell You Right Now\n\nEven without the question, I can identify significant problems with what you've written:\n\n### Issue Spotting — *Cannot Evaluate Yet*\nI don't know what issues were in the fact pattern. But I can already see you only addressed **one framework** (minimum contacts), which suggests you may have missed issues entirely. Personal jurisdiction questions typically require you to consider:\n- General vs. specific jurisdiction\n- Purposeful availment\n- Reasonableness/Burger King factors\n- Possibly consent, tag jurisdiction, or domicile\n\n### Rule Statement — **Needs Significant Work**\nYou cited *International Shoe* — good instinct. But your rule statement is dangerously thin. Compare what you wrote:\n\n> *\"Under International Shoe, there needs to be minimum contacts.\"*\n\nA stronger rule statement would look more like:\n\n> *\"Under* International Shoe v. Washington*, a court may exercise personal jurisdiction over a nonresident defendant where the defendant has sufficient minimum contacts with the forum state such that maintenance of the suit does not offend 'traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.' Specific jurisdiction requires that the plaintiff's claim arise out of or relate to the defendant's contacts with the forum. Courts assess whether the defendant purposefully availed itself of the privilege of conducting activities in the forum state, such that it could reasonably anticipate being haled into court there.\"*\n\nNotice the difference — the stronger version gives the **full standard**, breaks it into **elements**, and sets up the analysis that follows.\n\n### Application — **This Is the Biggest Problem**\nThis is where answers are won and lost, and right now you have almost none:\n\n> *\"Here there are minimum contacts so the court has jurisdiction.\"*\n\nThis is a **conclusion, not analysis.** You haven't connected any facts to any legal standard. A professor reading this has no idea *why* you think there are minimum contacts. \n\nThe pattern you need to practice is: **Fact → Legal Significance → Conclusion**. Something like: *\"Defendant did X [fact], which demonstrates purposeful availment because [legal reasoning], therefore...\"*\n\n### Counterarguments — **Absent**\nThere's no engagement with the other side. Even if jurisdiction is clearly proper, you should acknowledge the strongest argument against it and explain why it fails.\n\n### Organization — **Needs Structure**\nThree sentences with no headings, no IRAC structure, no signposting. On a Civ Pro exam, your professor wants to see organized, methodical analysis.\n\n---\n\n## The Pattern I'm Already Seeing\n\nYou know the *name* of the doctrine but are skipping the work of actually applying it. This is one of the most common 1L exam habits, and it will hurt you across **every subject** — not just Civ Pro. The fix is practicing the discipline of never writing a conclusion without first writing the reasoning that earns it.\n\n---\n\n## Next Step\n\n**Post the fact pattern.** Once I have it, I can tell you what issues you should have spotted, walk through what your application section should have engaged with, and show you a short example of how one issue should be analyzed — so you can practice doing the rest yourself."
