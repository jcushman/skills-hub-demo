      "content": "Great — I have everything I need. Here's my feedback.\n\n---\n\n## Overall Impression\n\nYou've got a solid foundation here. You correctly identified consideration as a central issue, stated the rule accurately, and reached a reasonable conclusion on breach. That's real credit on an exam. But this answer is leaving significant points on the table — both by missing a major doctrine and by not fully developing the analysis you did start. Let's dig in.\n\n---\n\n## Dimension-by-Dimension Feedback\n\n### 1. Issue Spotting — Needs Work\n\n**What you got right:** Consideration and breach of contract are legitimate issues and you were right to raise them.\n\n**What you missed:** The biggest gap is **promissory estoppel**. This fact pattern is practically a textbook promissory estoppel hypo. Ask yourself: what happens if a court finds the contract *wasn't* fully formed, or if Alice argues the offer was revocable before completion? Bob *relied* on Alice's promise by beginning performance — he's now halfway through a job and out the time and resources he spent. Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 90 exists precisely for situations like this.\n\nOn an issue-spotter, your job is to identify *every viable theory of recovery*, not just the strongest one. A strong answer would discuss:\n- Breach of contract (you got this)\n- **Promissory estoppel** (you missed this)\n- Potentially **quasi-contract/unjust enrichment** — Bob conferred a partial benefit on Alice; she may be unjustly enriched if she keeps a half-painted house without paying anything\n\nMissing promissory estoppel on this fact pattern would likely cost you significant points on most rubrics.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Rule Statement — Adequate, But Thin\n\nYour consideration rule is correct: *\"a bargained-for exchange where each party gives something of value.\"* That's a fine core definition.\n\nBut it could be sharper. Consider adding that the exchange must be **sought by the promisor in exchange for the promise**, and that **performance or a return promise** can both qualify as consideration. This matters here because Bob's *performance* (painting) — not just a promise to paint — is what he's exchanging.\n\n**A stronger rule statement might read:**\n> *\"Consideration requires a bargained-for exchange in which each party's promise or performance is sought by the other as the price of their own commitment. A promise is supported by consideration if the promisee's act, forbearance, or return promise is bargained for and given in exchange for the promisor's promise.\"*\n\nThat's not dramatically longer — but it's more precise and signals doctrinal fluency.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Application — This Is the Weakest Part\n\nThis is where your answer needs the most work. You state the rule and jump almost immediately to a conclusion. Look at this passage:\n\n> *\"Alice promised $5,000 and Bob promised to paint, so there is consideration and a valid contract.\"*\n\nThis is **conclusory**. You're telling the reader the answer without showing the reasoning. On a law school exam, the analysis *is* the grade. A professor wants to see you **connect the facts to the rule elements explicitly**.\n\n**Here's what a stronger application looks like for just the consideration issue:**\n> *\"Alice's promise to pay $5,000 was made in exchange for Bob's painting her house. Bob's act of painting — beginning performance — was the very thing Alice sought when she made her promise. Bob, in turn, began painting in reliance on Alice's promise of payment. Each party's commitment was thus bargained for and given in exchange for the other's, satisfying the consideration requirement.\"*\n\nNotice the difference: the stronger version **names the facts**, **ties them to each element**, and **explains why** the element is satisfied. That's the habit you want to build.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Counterarguments — Missing\n\nYou don't engage with any counterarguments. For example:\n\n- Could Alice argue the contract was an **offer for a unilateral contract** (paint the house, *then* I'll pay), which she could revoke before completion? This is a classic issue — and the **Restatement § 45** answer is that once performance begins, the offer becomes irrevocable. That's worth raising and resolving.\n- On promissory estoppel, Alice might argue Bob's reliance wasn't reasonable or that injustice doesn't require enforcement. Addressing and rebutting that strengthens your answer.\n\nYou don't need to write a brief for both sides — but acknowledging and disposing of the strongest counterargument shows analytical sophistication.\n\n---\n\n### 5. Organization and Clarity — Functional, But Could Be Stronger\n\nYour answer is readable and logical. That's genuinely good — many students write confusingly. But right now it reads as one undifferentiated paragraph. On a multi-issue exam answer, **use headings or clear transitions** to signal when you're moving to a new issue. Something as simple as:\n\n> **I. Breach of Contract**\n> **II. Promissory Estoppel**\n> **III. Unjust Enrichment**\n\n...tells the grader you've organized your thinking and makes it easy to award you points for each issue.\n\n---\n\n## Recurring Patterns to Watch\n\n**Strength to build on:** You move efficiently and write clearly. You don't ramble. That's a real asset — many students bury their analysis in unnecessary throat-clearing. Keep that.\n\n**Pattern to fix — conclusory analysis:** The jump from rule → conclusion without working through the facts is the single most common reason strong students lose points on law school exams. Every time you write a conclusion, ask yourself: *\"Did I show my work?\"* If you can't point to a sentence that connects a specific fact to a specific element, you skipped a step.\n\n**Pattern to fix — single-theory thinking:** You found one valid claim and stopped. Train yourself to ask: *\"What if this theory fails? What else does the plaintiff have?\"* Plaintiffs' lawyers plead in the alternative for a reason.\n\n---\n\n## Suggested Practice Strategies\n\nGiven what I'm seeing, here's what I'd focus on next:\n\n1. **Promissory estoppel drill:** Pull 3–4 fact patterns and practice spotting when § 90 is in play. The triggers are: a clear promise, foreseeable reliance, actual reliance, and injustice without enforcement. Quiz yourself on whether each element is present before writing anything.\n\n2. **Application practice — the \"because\" exercise:** After every conclusion you write, force yourself to write the word *\"because\"* and finish the sentence using specific facts. If you can't, you haven't applied the rule yet.\n\n3. **Issue checklist:** Before you write your next exam answer, spend 2–3 minutes listing every possible claim or defense. Only then start writing. This separates issue-spotting from drafting and helps you catch what you'd otherwise miss under time pressure.\n\n4. **Re-answer this question:** Try rewriting this answer incorporating the feedback above — especially adding promissory estoppel and deepening your consideration application. Comparing your two drafts is one of the most effective ways to internalize the feedback.\n\n---\n\nYou're building on a real foundation here. The core instincts are right — now it's about developing the depth and completeness that separates a good answer from a great one. Nice work getting a practice answer on paper; that's how you improve."
