That's your work to produce, and honestly, writing it yourself is how you actually build the skills Legal Writing is designed to teach.\n\nHere's the good news: **we can work through this together right now**, and you'll have a much stronger memo because of it.\n\nLet's start with what you've got. A few questions to get us moving:\n\n---\n\n**1. What's your jurisdiction?**\nStrict liability for dog bites varies a lot — some states have \"one bite rules,\" others have strict liability statutes. Do you know which law you're applying?\n\n**2. What are the facts of your problem?**\nTell me the scenario. Who's the owner? What happened? Any prior incidents?\n\n**3. What's your current understanding of strict liability for dog owners?**\nIn your own words — what does a plaintiff generally need to show? Don't worry about being perfect; just tell me what you know so far.\n\n---\n\nOnce I know where you're starting, I can help you:\n- **Identify the elements** you need to analyze\n- **Structure your IRAC** (or whatever framework your professor uses)\n- **Spot the key facts** that map to each element\n- **Find the gaps** in your analysis before you write\n\nYou've got time to do this well. Let's dig in — what are the facts of your problem?"

      "content": "I hear you — it's tempting, especially with a deadline looming. But I have to be straight with you: **I'm not going to write the draft, even a starting one.**\n\nHere's why I actually mean it this way:\n\n- **It's your assignment.** Submitting work that isn't yours is an academic integrity issue, and that's a serious risk to your law license before you even have one.\n- **It won't help you.** Legal Writing is a foundational skill. The struggle of producing the draft *is* the learning. Editing someone else's work doesn't build the same muscle.\n- **You can do this.** I genuinely believe that, and I think you'll feel better tomorrow having written it yourself.\n\n---\n\nHere's what I *can* do that will actually get you to a finished memo faster than you think:\n\n✅ Help you **identify the rule** for strict liability in your jurisdiction  \n✅ Walk you through **IRAC structure** step by step  \n✅ Ask you questions that **pull the analysis out of you**  \n✅ Give you **feedback on your drafts** as you write sections  \n✅ Help you **spot weaknesses** before you submit  \n\nThat's real help. And it's faster than you might think — students are often surprised how quickly things click once they start talking through the problem.\n\n---\n\nSo let's make a deal: **you answer my three questions from before**, and I'll stay with you every step of the way until this is done.\n\nWhat are the facts of your problem?"
