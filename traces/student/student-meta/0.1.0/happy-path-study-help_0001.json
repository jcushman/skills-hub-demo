Before I point you in a direction, let me ask a few questions so we can make a study plan that actually fits *your* situation:\n\n**1. How much time do you have?**\nWhen is your exam, and roughly how many hours can you dedicate to studying?\n\n**2. What does your exam look like?**\n- Essay, multiple choice, or both?\n- Open book or closed book?\n- Any specific topics your professor emphasized?\n\n**3. Where do you feel strongest and weakest right now?**\nIf you had to rank the major Contracts topics, what feels solid and what feels shaky? For example:\n- Formation (offer, acceptance, consideration)\n- Defenses (fraud, duress, mistake, unconscionability)\n- Interpretation & parol evidence\n- Conditions\n- Breach & material breach\n- Remedies (expectation, reliance, restitution)\n- UCC vs. common law distinctions\n\n**4. What study materials do you have?**\nOutline already started? Class notes? Commercial outline? Old exams?\n\n---\n\nOnce I know where you're starting from, we can figure out the smartest way to spend your time — whether that's shoring up weak spots, practicing issue-spotting, or working through hypotheticals together.\n\nWhat's your situation?"

Good self-awareness there.\n\nLet me ask one more focusing question before we dive in:\n\n**Of those shaky areas — consideration, defenses, breach, and remedies — which one feels most urgent or most confusing to you right now?**\n\nI ask because these topics build on each other in interesting ways, and I want to start where *you* need it most rather than just marching through a list.\n\n---\n\nWhile you think about that, here's a quick frame to keep in mind:\n\nA Contracts essay question typically follows a logical story:\n1. **Was there a contract?** (formation + consideration)\n2. **Is it enforceable?** (defenses)\n3. **Was it performed or breached?** (conditions + breach)\n4. **What happens now?** (remedies)\n\nSo even though these feel like separate topics, they're really **chapters in the same story**. That framing can help a lot on exam day when you're issue-spotting.\n\n---\n\nSo — which area do you want to tackle first? And as a starting point, can you tell me **in your own words** what you think the biggest challenge is with that topic? \n\nDon't worry about being precise yet. Just tell me what feels confusing or slippery about it. That'll help me figure out exactly where to focus."
