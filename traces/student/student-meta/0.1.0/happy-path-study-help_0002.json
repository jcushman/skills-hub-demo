Before I point you in a direction, let me ask a few questions so we can make a study plan that actually fits *your* situation:\n\n1. **How much time do you have?** When is your exam?\n\n2. **What format is it?** Essay, multiple choice, or a mix?\n\n3. **What does your professor emphasize?** Every Contracts course is a little different — some professors are heavily UCC-focused, others emphasize common law, some love policy questions, some are very doctrine-focused.\n\n4. **How are you feeling about the material right now?** Are there topics that feel solid, and topics that feel shaky or confusing?\n\n5. **Do you have an outline already**, or are you starting from scratch?\n\nYour answers will help me figure out where to focus our energy. But while you're thinking about those — here's a rough sense of the **big conceptual buckets** in a typical Contracts course:\n\n- Formation (offer, acceptance, consideration, mutual assent)\n- Defenses to formation (fraud, duress, mistake, unconscionability, etc.)\n- The statute of frauds\n- Contract interpretation & parol evidence\n- Conditions\n- Performance & breach\n- Remedies\n- UCC Article 2 (if your course covered it)\n\n**Quick self-check**: Without looking at your notes, can you tell me what the three elements of a valid contract are? Give it a shot — let's see where we're starting from!"

      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "That's really helpful — and honestly, knowing *where* you're shaky is half the battle. A lot of students go into exams not even knowing what they don't know, so you're already ahead.\n\nLet's be strategic. You've got a lot of ground to cover, so let's **prioritize by exam impact**. Breach and remedies tend to be heavily tested because they're where the analysis gets rich — professors love to see if you can spot a breach *and* then correctly calculate what flows from it.\n\nBut before we build a plan, let me ask a few more things:\n\n**On your \"OK\" feeling about formation** — let's test that a little. Can you walk me through what happens when an offer is accepted but the acceptance includes new or different terms? What's the common law rule, and how does it differ from the UCC approach (if your course covered UCC)?\n\nThis will help me calibrate whether formation is truly solid or just *familiar*.\n\n---\n\nAnd on the shaky areas — let's start to triage. When you say you feel shaky on **consideration, defenses, breach, and remedies**, can you tell me:\n\n- Is it that the **rules feel fuzzy**?\n- Or do you understand the rules but struggle to **apply them to fact patterns**?\n- Or both?\n\nThat distinction really matters for how we study. What do you think?"
