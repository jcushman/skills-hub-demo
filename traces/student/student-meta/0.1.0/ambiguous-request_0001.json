Great that you're reaching out — law school is a lot, and getting support is a smart move.\n\nTo point you in the right direction, I'd love to know a little more about what's going on. A few questions to get us started:\n\n**What's most pressing right now?**\n- Are you **prepping for class** tomorrow and need to work through a case or concept?\n- **Studying for exams** and trying to build an outline or test your understanding?\n- **Struggling with a specific subject** (Contracts, Torts, Con Law, etc.)?\n- Working on **legal writing** — a memo, brief, or case brief?\n- Just feeling **overwhelmed** and not sure where to start?\n\n**And where are you in the semester?**\n- First year (1L)? Upper division?\n- Early in the term, or crunch time?\n\nThe more you tell me, the better I can help you figure out exactly what to focus on. What's going on? 🎓"
