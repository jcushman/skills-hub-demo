Here's a good way to approach studying:\n\n## Start with the Big Picture Framework\n\nContracts law generally flows through these core questions:\n\n1. **Was a contract formed?** (offer, acceptance, consideration)\n2. **Is it enforceable?** (defenses like fraud, duress, unconscionability, Statute of Frauds)\n3. **What are the terms?** (interpretation, implied terms, parol evidence)\n4. **Was it performed or breached?** (conditions, material breach, excuse doctrines)\n5. **What are the remedies?** (expectation, reliance, restitution damages)\n\n## Good Starting Points\n\n- **Review your syllabus** - see what topics your professor emphasized\n- **Look at past exams** if available - your professor's style matters a lot\n- **Know your sources of law** - common law vs. UCC Article 2 (goods) is frequently tested\n\n## What Helps Most for Exams\n\n- Practice **issue spotting** with hypotheticals\n- Know the **elements** of each doctrine cold\n- Understand the **policy reasons** behind rules\n- Be able to apply **both sides** of arguments\n\n## Where Do You Want to Start?\n\nTell me:\n- **What topics feel weakest?**\n- **What does your exam format look like?**\n- **Any specific areas your professor stressed?**\n\nI can help you work through specific doctrines, practice hypos, or build an outline!"

Let's build a plan and then dive in systematically.\n\n## Suggested Study Order\n\nGiven what you said, I'd suggest tackling things in this order:\n\n1. **Consideration** - foundational, and it connects to defenses\n2. **Defenses** - lots of distinct doctrines to keep straight\n3. **Breach** (conditions, material breach, excuse) - often heavily tested\n4. **Remedies** - saves the most complex calculations for last\n\n## A Few Questions Before We Dive In\n\n- **Did you cover UCC Article 2** alongside common law, or mostly common law?\n- **Did your professor emphasize any particular cases** or restatement sections?\n- **What's your exam format** - issue spotter essays, multiple choice, or both?\n\n## How I'd Suggest We Work\n\nRather than just reviewing rules, I think you'll retain things better if we:\n- Go through the **key rules and elements** for each topic\n- Then **test you with a hypo** so you can practice applying them\n- Identify any **gaps** and fill them in\n\n---\n\n**Want to start with consideration?** It's a good place because it's deceptively tricky - students often think they understand it and then get surprised on exams.\n\nOr if there's a specific topic that's really worrying you, we can jump there first. What do you think?"
