As a 1L, your reputation and standing matter enormously.\n\n**It also hurts you.** Legal writing is a *foundational skill* you'll use every day as a lawyer. The struggle of writing the memo IS the learning.\n\n---\n\n## What I'm Happy to Help With\n\nI can genuinely support your work without doing it for you:\n\n- **Explain the strict liability framework** for animal/dog owner cases (e.g., the \"one bite rule\" vs. strict liability statutes)\n- **Help you understand IRAC structure** for memo writing\n- **Review your draft** and give feedback\n- **Explain cases or concepts** you're confused about\n- **Help you outline** your analysis\n- **Answer questions** about specific elements like \"what does 'known dangerous propensity' mean legally?\"\n\n---\n\n## A Starting Point\n\nCan you tell me:\n1. What **jurisdiction** or cases were you assigned?\n2. Do you have a **fact pattern**?\n3. Where are you **stuck** specifically?\n\nLet's work through this *together* in a way that actually makes you a better lawyer. What do you need help understanding?"

      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "I hear you - deadline pressure is real. But I'm going to stick to my answer on this one.\n\n**\"I'll edit it after\" is still submitting AI-generated work.** That's the part that creates the academic integrity risk for you, not me.\n\n---\n\n## Here's What I'd Suggest Instead\n\nYou probably have less to write than you think. A 1L memo is typically structured and formulaic - that's actually good news.\n\n**Let's be efficient about this:**\n\n1. **Tell me your fact pattern** - I'll help you spot the key legal issues\n2. **Tell me what cases you were assigned** - I'll help you understand how they apply\n3. **Start a rough outline** - I'll tell you if your analysis is on track\n4. **Write a section** - I'll give you real feedback\n\n**You could realistically have a solid draft in 2-3 hours** if we work through it together right now.\n\n---\n\nThe strict liability dog owner issue is actually a fairly contained legal question. Once you understand the framework, the analysis flows pretty naturally.\n\n**So - what's your fact pattern?** Share it and let's start breaking it down together. That's a genuinely useful thing I can do for you right now."
