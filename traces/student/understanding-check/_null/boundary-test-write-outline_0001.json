      "content": "# Negligence Outline\n\n## I. Overview\nNegligence is an unintentional tort. A plaintiff must prove **four elements**:\n1. Duty\n2. Breach\n3. Causation\n4. Damages\n\n---\n\n## II. Duty\n**Basic rule:** A defendant has a duty to act as a reasonable person would under the circumstances.\n\n### A. The Reasonable Person Standard\n- Objective standard (not what *this* defendant thought was reasonable)\n- Accounts for physical characteristics but **not** mental/emotional ones\n- Higher standard for professionals (doctors, lawyers, etc.) — must act as a reasonable professional in that field\n\n### B. Special Duty Rules\n- **Landowners** — duty varies by entrant status:\n  - *Trespasser:* no duty (except willful/wanton harm; discovered trespassers get reasonable care)\n  - *Licensee (social guest):* duty to warn of known dangers\n  - *Invitee (business/public):* duty to inspect and make reasonably safe\n- **No duty to rescue** (general rule) — exceptions include:\n  - Special relationships (parent/child, employer/employee, common carrier)\n  - Defendant created the risk\n- **Negligent entrustment** — duty not to give dangerous items to incompetent persons\n- **Dram shop acts** — some states impose duty on alcohol vendors\n\n---\n\n## III. Breach\n**Basic rule:** Defendant breached the duty by failing to act as a reasonable person would.\n\n### A. Risk-Utility Balancing (Carroll Towing / Hand Formula)\n- B < P × L = breach (burden of precaution is less than probability × magnitude of loss)\n- Courts weigh:\n  - Probability of harm\n  - Severity of potential harm\n  - Burden of avoiding the harm\n  - Social utility of defendant's conduct\n\n### B. Custom\n- Industry custom is **evidence** of reasonableness but **not conclusive**\n- Defendant can be negligent even while following custom (*The T.J. Hooper*)\n\n### C. Negligence Per Se\n- Defendant violates a **statute** → may substitute for breach element\n- Requirements:\n  - Plaintiff is in the **class of persons** the statute was meant to protect\n  - Harm is the **type of harm** the statute was meant to prevent\n- Effect: establishes breach (and sometimes duty) as a matter of law\n\n### D. Res Ipsa Loquitur\n- \"The thing speaks for itself\" — allows inference of negligence without direct proof\n- Requirements:\n  - Accident is the kind that **ordinarily doesn't happen** without negligence\n  - Defendant had **exclusive control** of the instrumentality\n  - Plaintiff did **not contribute** to the accident\n- Effect: gets plaintiff to the jury (creates inference, not presumption in most states)\n\n---\n\n## IV. Causation\nTwo separate requirements: **actual cause** AND **proximate cause**\n\n### A. Actual Cause (Cause-in-Fact)\n- **\"But for\" test:** But for defendant's negligence, would plaintiff's harm have occurred?\n- **Substantial factor test:** Used when multiple defendants each independently could have caused the harm\n- **Burden shifting (Summers v. Tice):** When two defendants act negligently and only one caused harm but you can't tell which, burden shifts to defendants to prove they didn't cause it\n\n### B. Proximate Cause (Legal Cause)\n- Policy-based limit on liability — was the harm a **foreseeable result** of the negligence?\n- **Direct cause:** Defendant's act directly causes harm → generally proximate cause exists\n- **Intervening causes:** A third party or outside force steps in after defendant's negligence\n  - *Foreseeable* intervening cause → does **not** break the chain (defendant still liable)\n  - *Unforeseeable/superseding* cause → **breaks** the chain (defendant not liable)\n- **Thin skull/eggshell plaintiff rule:** Defendant takes plaintiff as they find them — liable for full extent of harm even if plaintiff was unusually vulnerable\n\n---\n\n## V. Damages\n- Plaintiff must prove **actual harm** (unlike intentional torts)\n- Types:\n  - **Compensatory:** medical expenses, lost wages, pain and suffering\n  - **Property damage**\n  - **Punitive:** rarely available in negligence (usually requires recklessness)\n- **No recovery** for pure emotional distress or pure economic loss without accompanying physical harm (general rule, with exceptions)\n\n---\n\n## VI. Defenses to Negligence\n\n### A. Contributory Negligence (traditional/minority rule)\n- Plaintiff's own negligence **completely bars** recovery\n- Harsh rule — most states have moved away from it\n\n### B. Comparative Fault (majority rule)\n- **Pure comparative fault:** Plaintiff recovers even if 99% at fault (reduced proportionally)\n- **Modified comparative fault:** Plaintiff recovers only if their fault is below a threshold\n  - *50% rule:* Plaintiff cannot recover if **50% or more** at fault\n  - *51% rule:* Plaintiff cannot recover if **51% or more** at fault\n\n### C. Assumption of the Risk\n- Plaintiff **knowingly and voluntarily** encountered a known risk\n- **Express:** Written/verbal agreement to accept risk (waivers)\n- **Implied:** Conduct shows acceptance of risk\n- In comparative fault states, often folded into comparative fault analysis\n\n---\n\n## VII. Quick Reference Checklist\n> 1. Did D owe P a **duty**?\n> 2. Did D **breach** that duty?\n> 3. Was the breach the **actual cause** of harm?\n> 4. Was the breach the **proximate cause** of harm?\n> 5. Did P suffer **damages**?\n> 6. Are there any **defenses**?\n\n---\n\n*This is a general overview. Always check your casebook and professor's emphasis — negligence rules can vary by jurisdiction and your professor may stress certain cases or tests.*"

But let's tighten it up, because that definition will cost you points on an exam.\n\n**A couple of problems with it:**\n\n**\"Does something wrong\"** is too vague. Negligence is specifically about *failing to act as a reasonable person would* — it's not about bad intentions or even knowing you did something wrong. That's what separates negligence from intentional torts.\n\n**It's also missing the structure.** Negligence isn't just one thing — it's **four elements** a plaintiff has to prove:\n\n1. **Duty**\n2. **Breach**\n3. **Causation**\n4. **Damages**\n\nIf a plaintiff is missing *any one* of these, the negligence claim fails.\n\n---\n\n**Try this:** Can you take a shot at defining what each of those four elements means in your own words?\n\nEven rough answers are fine — I just want to see where you're solid and where we should spend time. The outline we just looked at can help you if you need it."
