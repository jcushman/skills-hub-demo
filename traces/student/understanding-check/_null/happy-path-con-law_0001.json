Constitutional Law is a rich subject and it's smart to check your understanding before the midterm.\n\nGiven what you've covered, we could work through:\n\n- **Due Process** (substantive and procedural, fundamental rights, levels of scrutiny)\n- **Equal Protection** (classification types, rational basis, intermediate, strict scrutiny)\n- **Commerce Clause** (Lopez/Morrison framework, channels/instrumentalities/substantial effects)\n\n**A few ways we could approach this:**\n\n1. You explain a concept to me and I tell you what's solid and what needs refinement\n2. I ask you hypothetical questions like a professor might\n3. We work through specific cases you're uncertain about\n4. You share a practice question and we analyze it together\n\n**My honest suggestion** would be option 1 or 2, because *actively retrieving* the material will show you more clearly where your gaps are than just reading a summary would.\n\nWhat sounds most useful to you, and is there a particular area you feel least confident about? That's usually the best place to start."

That's where checking your understanding will matter most before the midterm.\n\nYou could:\n1. **Explain a doctrine to me** and I'll push back where needed\n2. **Work through a hypo** together\n3. **Tell me a specific case or concept** you're unsure about\n\nWhat's it going to be?"

Let me push on a few things to sharpen it:\n\n**What's strong:**\n- The procedural/substantive distinction is correct\n- The hearing example for procedural due process is good\n\n**Where I'd push you to be more precise:**\n\nOn procedural due process, your description is a bit incomplete. The key framework is actually a **two-step inquiry:**\n1. Is there a protected life, liberty, or **property interest** at stake?\n2. If yes, what process is due? (This is the *Mathews v. Eldridge* balancing test)\n\nCan you tell me what the three *Mathews* factors are?\n\n---\n\nOn substantive due process, \"good enough reason\" is vague in a way that could hurt you on an exam. The doctrine really turns on a **threshold question** before you even get to the government's reason:\n\n- Is the right **fundamental** or not?\n- That answer determines your scrutiny level\n\n**Here's a question that gets at something important:** How does a court decide whether a right is fundamental under substantive due process? This is where the doctrine gets contested - and where *Glucksberg* and *Obergefell* create real tension.\n\nWhat's your understanding there?"

But this is an area where precision really matters on exams, so let me push you in a few directions:\n\n**What's solid:**\n- Correct that differential treatment needs justification\n- Correct on race/strict scrutiny and rational basis as the default\n\n**Where I'd sharpen things:**\n\nYou're missing a **middle tier entirely** - intermediate scrutiny. What classifications trigger it, and what's the standard?\n\n---\n\n**Also, your strict scrutiny description needs more precision.** Can you tell me:\n- What exactly does the government need to show under strict scrutiny?\n- And under rational basis?\n\nThe specific verbal formulations matter because they reflect **how hard it actually is** to win under each standard.\n\n---\n\n**Here's a deeper question worth thinking about:**\n\nRational basis is supposed to mean the government *can* treat people differently for almost any reason. But look at cases like *Romer v. Evans* or *City of Cleburne v. Cleburne Living Center* - the Court nominally applies rational basis but strikes down the law anyway.\n\nWhat's going on there doctrinally? Some people call it **rational basis with bite** - do you know what that means and when courts seem to apply it?\n\nThat's exactly the kind of nuance that separates strong exam answers from average ones."
