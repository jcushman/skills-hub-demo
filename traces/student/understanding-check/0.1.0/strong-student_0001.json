Let's make sure your confidence is well-placed and identify anything worth sharpening before exam day.\n\nBefore we dive in, a few quick questions to calibrate the diagnostic:\n\n1. **Course scope**: Is this a standard Criminal Procedure survey (Fourth, Fifth, Sixth Amendment — search and seizure, interrogation, right to counsel), or does it cover adjudicative procedure too (charging, plea bargaining, trial rights, sentencing)?\n\n2. **How far along**: Have you finished all the major units, or are there topics you haven't gotten to yet?\n\n3. **Materials**: Do you have a syllabus, outline, or case list you can paste or upload? Even a rough list of the major cases you've covered would help me ask you about the right things.\n\n4. **Any self-identified weak spots?** Even if you feel solid overall, is there anything that felt slippery or that you've spent less time on?\n\nThe more you share, the sharper I can make this. But if you want to just jump in, tell me the major topics you've covered and we'll get started."

Given that you're a 3L with a strong foundation, I'm going to push you on reasoning and application, not just rule recitation. I want to see how you *think* through the doctrine, not just whether you've memorized it.\n\nLet's run through five concepts, building from foundational to more nuanced. Take each one seriously — explain it like you're teaching it or answering an exam question.\n\n---\n\n**Concept 1 — Start here:**\n\n### The Third-Party Doctrine\n\nExplain how the third-party doctrine works under the Fourth Amendment, why the Court developed it, and what its limits are. Then tell me: *how does* Carpenter v. United States *fit into — or complicate — that framework?*\n\n---\n\nTake your time. Give me a real explanation, not bullet points. Once I see how you handle this one, I'll adjust the difficulty and focus of the next four based on what you show me."

That's a genuine strength.\n\nBut I want to push you, because you didn't answer the question I asked. **I asked about the third-party doctrine and *Carpenter*.** You gave me the exclusionary rule instead. That could be a significant issue on an exam — if you're pattern-matching to familiar doctrine rather than reading the question carefully, you can lose a lot of points even when you know the material.\n\nSo: was that a misread, or did you mean to pivot? Either way, let's do both.\n\n---\n\n**First, come back to my original question:**\n\nExplain the third-party doctrine — how it works, why it developed, and how *Carpenter* fits or complicates it.\n\n**Then, since you brought up the exclusionary rule**, let me push you a bit further on what you said:\n\nYou mentioned attenuation as an exception — **how does attenuation actually work?** Walk me through the *Brown v. Illinois* factors and explain how *Utah v. Strieff* applied them. This is where a lot of students go shallow.\n\n---\n\nTwo things to address. Take them in order. Let's see the depth."
