Let's make sure you're walking in confident.\n\nBefore we dive in, I have a few quick questions to tailor this to your specific course:\n\n1. **Your professor's approach**: Does your professor emphasize a particular framework or set of cases? (For example, some professors are very doctrine-focused; others spend a lot of time on theory and policy rationales.)\n\n2. **Your materials**: Do you have a syllabus, outline, or case list you can paste or upload? Even a rough list of the cases you've covered would help me ask you about the *right* things — not just generic Con Law doctrine.\n\n3. **Your gut check**: Going into this, which of the three areas — **due process**, **equal protection**, or the **commerce clause** — feels shakiest to you? Which feels strongest?\n\n4. **Exam format**: Do you know whether the midterm is essay-based, multiple choice, or a mix? That affects what kind of understanding we should stress-test.\n\nThe more you can share, the more targeted I can make this. But if you want to just jump in, tell me what you've got and we'll work with it. \n\nWhat do you have for me?"

      "content": "Perfect — that's a solid chunk of doctrine to work with. Those three areas connect in interesting ways, and they're all exam favorites for good reason.\n\nSince I don't have your specific syllabus or case list, I'll work with the **core doctrine and landmark cases** that are standard in most Con Law courses. If something I ask about doesn't match what you've covered, just flag it and we'll adjust.\n\nLet's get into it. I'll ask you to explain **four concepts** — they build from foundational to more complex. Take your time with each one; I'm looking for your *reasoning*, not just rule recitation.\n\n---\n\n## Concept 1: Due Process — Substantive vs. Procedural\n\n**In your own words: What's the difference between substantive and procedural due process, and why does the distinction matter?**\n\nDon't just give me the definitions — tell me:\n- What work is each doctrine doing?\n- What is a court actually asking when it applies each one?\n\nTake a shot at it, and then we'll dig into what you've got before moving to the next concept. There are no trick questions here — just show me how you're thinking about it."

That's a foundation to build on.\n\nBut let's push deeper, because what you've given me so far is **surface-level** — enough to identify the doctrines, but not enough to *apply* them on an exam. Here's what I'm seeing:\n\n---\n\n### What You Got Right ✓\n- Procedural due process = the *process* you're owed before deprivation. Correct.\n- Substantive due process = whether the government has sufficient *justification*. Correct direction.\n- The property/hearing example is a classic procedural due process illustration. Good instinct.\n\n---\n\n### Where I Want to Push You\n\n**On procedural due process**, your explanation is missing a key analytical step. Before asking \"what process is owed,\" courts ask something threshold question. What is it? \n\n*Hint: Not every government action triggers procedural due process protection. What has to exist first?*\n\n**On substantive due process**, \"good enough reason\" is vague in a way that could hurt you on an exam. The doctrine has a crucial fork in it:\n\n- How does a court decide *how much* justification the government needs?\n- What's the concept that determines which standard applies?\n- Can you name the two tiers and what triggers each?\n\n---\n\nTake another pass at both. What do you think the threshold question is for procedural due process, and what determines the level of scrutiny in substantive due process?"

Take a shot at them — what do you think?\n\n---\n\n*(And don't worry — we'll absolutely get to equal protection. What you said has some good pieces in it, but also some important gaps we'll want to work through together.)*"
