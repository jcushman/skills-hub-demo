But here's the thing: **handing you an outline won't actually tell you what you already know** — and I'd bet you know more than you think.\n\nIf you study from an outline I wrote, you might recognize concepts without being able to *use* them on an exam. What will actually help you is figuring out **exactly where your gaps are** so you can focus your limited time on what matters most. That's what I'm here to do.\n\nLet's do a quick diagnostic together. It won't take long, and you'll come out of it with a clear picture of what you've got solid and what needs work — which is way more useful than a generic outline.\n\n**To get started, just tell me:**\n\n1. **How far into negligence are you?** For example, have you covered duty, breach, causation, and damages? Or are you still in the middle of it?\n2. **Do you have any materials handy** — a syllabus, case list, or your own notes? Even a rough list of cases you've read would help me tailor this to *your* class.\n\nOnce I know where you are, I'll ask you to walk me through a few concepts in your own words. We'll figure out what you've got, what needs sharpening, and what to prioritize. Deal?"

      "content": "That's a start — and I'm glad you're willing to give this a shot! You've got the intuition right: negligence is about someone doing something wrong that causes harm. But on an exam, that intuition needs to become a precise analytical framework, so let's dig in.\n\nBefore we go further, I still need a little context so I can tailor this to **your** class:\n\n1. **What cases have you read?** Even just rattling off names helps — *Palsgraf*, *Carroll Towing*, *Byrne v. Boadle*, anything ring a bell?\n2. **Has your professor covered all four elements** — duty, breach, causation, damages — or are you still working through them?\n3. **Any notes or a syllabus you can paste in?** Even a rough case list works.\n\nThis will help me ask you the *right* questions rather than generic ones.\n\n---\n\nThat said, I want to push on what you said just a little:\n\nYou said negligence is \"when someone does something wrong and hurts you.\" Here's a question to chew on:\n\n> **Is it enough that someone did something wrong AND someone got hurt? Or does something more need to connect those two things?**\n\nThink about it — don't look anything up. Just tell me what your gut says. There's no wrong answer here, and your instinct will tell me a lot about where we are. 🎯"
