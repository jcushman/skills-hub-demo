Before we dive in, I need a little context so I can ask you the right questions.\n\n**Tell me about your course:**\n\n1. **What subject or course is this for?** (e.g., Contracts, Constitutional Law, Civil Procedure, Criminal Law, etc.)\n\n2. **Where are you in the course?** What topics have you covered so far? What's coming up next — a class, a midterm, a final?\n\n3. **Any materials you can share?** If you have a syllabus, outline, case list, or notes, paste them in or upload them. That helps me tailor the questions to exactly what you're responsible for.\n\nEven a quick answer like *\"Torts, halfway through the semester, just finished negligence\"* gives me enough to get started. What have you been studying?"

What can you tell me?"
