Pierson, knowing that Post was chasing the fox, killed and carried off the fox himself. Post sued.\n\n## The Rule\n**To establish property rights in a wild animal, you must have actual possession or deprive the animal of its natural liberty** — meaning you must either:\n- **Physically capture** the animal, or\n- **Mortally wound** it such that capture is virtually certain\n\n**Mere pursuit is not enough** to establish a property right.\n\n## Holding\nPierson won. Because Post had only been chasing the fox — without wounding or trapping it — he had no property right in it. Pierson, by actually killing it, was the one who reduced it to possession.\n\n## The Dissent\nJudge Livingston dissented, arguing that the rule should be more practical — whoever is in **reasonable pursuit** with a reasonable chance of capture should have priority. He was concerned the majority's rule would discourage fox hunting (considered a public good because foxes were pests).\n\n## Key Takeaway for Class\nThe case stands for the principle that **labor/effort alone doesn't create property rights** — you need actual control or possession. It also illustrates the tension between clear, administrable rules vs. more flexible, policy-driven standards."
