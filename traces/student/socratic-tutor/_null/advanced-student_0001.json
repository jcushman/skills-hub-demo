Harris*, the Court grounded abstention in principles of \"Our Federalism\" and \"comity.\" But Justice Black's opinion is notably vague about the *precise constitutional or statutory basis* for the doctrine.\n\n**Is Younger abstention constitutionally required, or is it a judicially-created prudential doctrine? And why does the answer to that question matter for Congress's power to abrogate it?**\n\nTake your time — I'm looking for a nuanced answer, not just a label."

I asked about the *why* at a deeper level — specifically:\n\n**If Younger is purely a judicially-created prudential doctrine rather than constitutionally compelled, what follows for Congress's ability to override it?**\n\nThink about this: Congress passed 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and the federal courts have jurisdiction under § 1331 and § 1343. \n\n- If Younger is just judicial policy-making, can Congress simply *tell* federal courts they *must* hear § 1983 claims even when state criminal proceedings are pending?\n- Or is there something in the constitutional structure — maybe Article III, maybe the Tenth Amendment, maybe something else — that would constrain even Congress's ability to abrogate Younger?\n\n**And here's the harder edge of the question:** Some scholars argue Younger is actually doing *constitutional* work disguised as prudential doctrine. What constitutional provision might support that reading, and what are the implications if they're right?\n\nDon't just tell me what Younger says — tell me what you *think* the best answer is and why."
