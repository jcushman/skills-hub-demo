But here's the thing: if your professor cold-calls you tomorrow, they won't ask \"what's the rule?\" and then wait quietly while you recite it. They'll *push* — on the facts, the reasoning, the dissent, hypotheticals. A memorized rule won't carry you through that.\n\nThe best way I can help you prepare is to work through it together, the way class will actually go. It'll stick better, and you'll be ready to think on your feet.\n\nSo let's start easy — **what happened in *Pierson v. Post*?** Just tell me the basic facts as you understand them. Don't worry about getting it perfect."

It matters more than you might think.)"
