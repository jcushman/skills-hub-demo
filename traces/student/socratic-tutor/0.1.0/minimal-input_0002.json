(Intentional torts, battery, assault?)\n  - Into negligence? (Duty, breach, causation, damages?)\n  - Further along? (Products liability, strict liability, defamation?)\n- **Any particular concern?** Cold calls on the reasoning? Policy arguments? Hypotheticals?\n\nEven a rough answer gets us started.
