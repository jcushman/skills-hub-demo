But \"comity and respect for state court processes\" is doing a lot of work there, and I want to push on it.\n\nThe Court in *Younger* actually grounds the doctrine in something more specific than just comity as a general sentiment. Justice Black's opinion invokes a particular historical and structural concept — one that predates *Younger* itself and connects to how federal courts understand their own role relative to state proceedings.\n\n**What is that deeper structural principle, and where does it come from?**\n\nAnd while you're thinking about that — you rattled off the exceptions quickly. Let's make sure those are solid. You said \"patently unconstitutional statute\" — **what does that actually mean as a legal standard, and how does it differ from just arguing your prosecution is unconstitutional?**\n\nPick whichever thread you want to pull first."
