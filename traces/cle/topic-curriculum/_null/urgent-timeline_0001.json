      "content": "# ERISA Crash Course for New Client Matter\n\nHere's a practical framework to get you oriented quickly.\n\n---\n\n## What ERISA Is (The 30-Second Version)\n\nThe Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 is a **federal law governing most private employer benefit plans** — retirement plans (401k, pension) and welfare benefit plans (health, disability, life insurance). It sets standards for:\n- Fiduciary duties\n- Reporting/disclosure\n- Claims and appeals\n- Preemption of state law\n\n---\n\n## First: Identify What TYPE of Matter This Is\n\nThis determines everything. The main categories are:\n\n### 🔹 Benefit Claim Disputes\n- Employee denied benefits (disability, health, retirement)\n- Most common litigation matter\n- Key issue: **standard of review** (de novo vs. abuse of discretion)\n\n### 🔹 Fiduciary Breach\n- Plan administrator or employer mismanaged plan assets\n- High-stakes, often class actions (think 401k fee cases)\n\n### 🔹 Plan Administration/Compliance\n- Employer-side: plan documents, amendments, compliance failures\n- ERISA requires specific plan document language\n\n### 🔹 Retaliation/Interference\n- Section 510 claims — employer fired someone to prevent benefits vesting\n\n---\n\n## Critical Concepts to Know Before the Call\n\n### Preemption — ERISA's \"Nuclear Weapon\"\n- ERISA **preempts virtually all state law claims** relating to employee benefit plans\n- This means: no state tort claims, no breach of contract under state law\n- **Remedies are very limited** — this is often the biggest shock to clients\n- Exception: insurance regulation (the \"saving clause\")\n\n### Limited Remedies\nUnder ERISA §502(a), plaintiffs can typically only recover:\n- The **benefit itself** (not consequential damages)\n- **No punitive damages** in most circuits\n- Attorney's fees (discretionary)\n- This is a major client counseling point\n\n### The Administrative Record Rule\n- In benefit denial cases, courts usually **only review the record before the plan administrator**\n- Discovery is very limited\n- You must **exhaust administrative remedies first**\n\n### Fiduciary Duty Standard\n- Higher than corporate law in some respects\n- Duty of loyalty, prudence, diversification, following plan documents\n\n---\n\n## Immediate Intake Questions for the Client Call\n\n**Identify the plan:**\n- What type of plan? (retirement, health, disability, life insurance)\n- Is it a single-employer or multiemployer (union) plan?\n- Is there a plan document? (Get it immediately)\n- Who is the plan administrator?\n\n**Identify the dispute:**\n- Was a claim filed and denied?\n- What was the reason for denial?\n- What stage is the appeals process at?\n\n**Critical deadlines:**\n- When was the denial issued?\n- Have internal appeals been exhausted?\n- **Statute of limitations** — varies by plan and circuit, can be very short\n\n**The employer side:**\n- Is your client the employer or the employee/participant?\n- This completely changes your role and analysis\n\n---\n\n## Statute of Limitations — Flag Immediately\n\n- ERISA has **no uniform federal statute of limitations**\n- Courts look to the plan document (often 3 years from denial)\n- Some plans have **very short contractual limitations periods** (as short as 180 days after final denial)\n- **Check this on day one** — it may be your most urgent issue\n\n---\n\n## Key Documents to Request Immediately\n\n- [ ] Summary Plan Description (SPD)\n- [ ] Full Plan Document\n- [ ] All denial letters\n- [ ] The complete claims file (participants have a right to this)\n- [ ] Any correspondence with the plan administrator\n\n---\n\n## The Landscape of Who You Might Be Representing\n\n| Client | Likely Issues |\n|--------|--------------|\n| Employee/participant | Benefit denial, retaliation, breach of fiduciary duty |\n| Employer | Plan compliance, fiduciary exposure, defense of claims |\n| Plan administrator | Fiduciary duties, claims procedures |\n\n---\n\n## Resources to Get Smart Fast\n\n**Primary sources:**\n- 29 U.S.C. §§ 1001–1461 (the statute)\n- DOL regulations at 29 C.F.R.\n\n**Practical resources:**\n- **Westlaw/Lexis ERISA practice guides** — get one pulled today\n- *Employee Benefits Law* (BNA) — the standard treatise\n- Your circuit's leading ERISA cases on standard of review\n\n**DOL website:**\n- dol.gov/agencies/ebsa — surprisingly useful for plan documents and participant rights\n\n---\n\n## What to Tell the Client on the Call (Manage Expectations)\n\n1. ERISA is **highly technical and federal** — state law remedies likely don't apply\n2. Remedies may be **more limited than they expect**\n3. The **administrative record matters enormously** — what's in the file now may be all you get\n4. Deadlines may be **very tight** — you need documents immediately\n5. You will need to **review the plan document** before giving substantive advice\n\n---\n\n## Your 4-Day Prep Plan\n\n| Day | Task |\n|-----|------|\n| Today | Read this overview; pull your circuit's key ERISA cases on standard of review; identify the claim type |\n| Day 2 | Read a practice guide chapter on your specific issue; pull the plan documents if possible |\n| Day 3 | Research statute of limitations issue; identify any immediate deadlines |\n| Day 4 | Prepare intake questions; outline issues; identify what you need from client |\n\n---\n\n**Bottom line for the call:** Listen carefully, ask the intake questions above, get all documents, and **do not give substantive advice** until you've reviewed the plan document and confirmed there are no immediate deadline issues.\n\nWould you like me to go deeper on any specific area — benefit denials, fiduciary claims, preemption, or the employer-side perspective?"
