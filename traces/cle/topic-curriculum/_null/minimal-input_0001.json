Let me give you a structured overview to help you get started.\n\n## Core Areas of Employment Law\n\n### Federal Statutes\n- **Title VII** (Civil Rights Act) - discrimination based on race, sex, religion, national origin\n- **ADEA** - age discrimination (40+)\n- **ADA** - disability discrimination\n- **FLSA** - wage and hour, overtime, minimum wage\n- **FMLA** - family and medical leave\n- **NLRA** - collective bargaining, union rights\n- **OSHA** - workplace safety\n\n### Key Concepts\n- At-will employment and exceptions\n- Protected classes and characteristics\n- Hostile work environment\n- Retaliation claims\n- Independent contractor vs. employee classification\n- Wrongful termination\n\n## Suggested Learning Approaches\n\n1. **Treatises** - Lindemann & Grossman's Employment Discrimination Law\n2. **PLI or CLE courses** - practical, up-to-date\n3. **EEOC website** - guidance documents\n4. **Westlaw/Lexis** - practice guides\n5. **State-specific resources** - employment law varies significantly by state\n\n## Questions to Help Me Help You\n\n- What **jurisdiction** are you in?\n- Are you representing **employers or employees**?\n- Any **specific issue** (discrimination, wage/hour, etc.)?\n- What's your **current knowledge level**?\n\nWould you like to narrow the focus?"
