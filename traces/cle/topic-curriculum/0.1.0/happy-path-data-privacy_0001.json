What kind of matters are coming in?**\n- Breach response and litigation?\n- Compliance counseling (privacy programs, policies, vendor contracts)?\n- Regulatory defense (FTC, state AG, CPPA)?\n- All of the above?\n\n**2. What industries are your clients in?**\nPrivacy law is highly sector-specific. Healthcare (HIPAA), financial services (GLBA), adtech, and general commercial companies each have different regulatory exposure. Knowing your client base tells me which frameworks to prioritize.\n\n**3. Geography?**\n- Primarily U.S.-based clients, or do you have international exposure (EU/GDPR)?\n- California clients specifically? (CCPA/CPRA has its own enforcement apparatus and is often the first state law practitioners need to master.)\n\n**4. What's your actual timeline?**\nYou mentioned a few months — but is there a specific matter or client pitch coming up in the near term that's driving urgency? \"A few months to build general competence\" and \"I have a client call in three weeks\" call for different sequencing.\n\n**5. Any existing exposure?**\nHave you touched privacy at all — discovery disputes involving data, a HIPAA business associate agreement, a breach notification letter? Even tangential exposure tells me where you're starting from.\n\nThe more specific you can be, the more targeted I can make this. That said, if you want me to build a general U.S. data privacy curriculum now and we refine from there, I can do that too."

    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "That's actually a good position to be in — three months is enough time to build real competence if you're systematic about it, and starting from zero means no bad habits to unlearn.\n\nI still need two more answers before I build this out properly:\n\n**1. What kind of work is coming in?**\n\nThis is the most important question. The curriculum for a breach response litigator looks very different from the curriculum for a compliance counselor drafting privacy programs. Even a rough sense helps:\n\n- **Transactional/compliance**: Privacy policies, data processing agreements, vendor contracts, building client privacy programs\n- **Breach response**: Incident response, notification obligations, regulatory investigations, follow-on litigation\n- **Regulatory defense**: FTC enforcement, state AG actions, CPPA proceedings\n- **Some mix** — and if so, which is likely to dominate?\n\nYour litigation background is a genuine asset for breach response and regulatory defense work. If that's where the matters are coming from, I'll weight the curriculum accordingly.\n\n**2. What industries are your clients in?**\n\nEven a general answer helps. \"Mostly mid-market commercial companies\" is different from \"healthcare\" or \"tech/adtech.\" Sector-specific overlays (HIPAA, GLBA, COPPA) can add significant complexity and may need their own curriculum track.\n\n---\n\nIf you genuinely don't know yet what's coming in, tell me that — I'll build a foundational curriculum that covers the core U.S. framework first and flags where you'll need to specialize once the matters clarify."
