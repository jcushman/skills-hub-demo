What's driving this?**\n- New client matter landing on your desk?\n- Thinking about adding employment to your practice?\n- Lateral move or firm expansion?\n- Something specific happened (e.g., a client just got sued)?\n\n**2. Which side of employment law?**\nThis is a big field with distinct practice tracks:\n- **Employer-side** (defending companies in litigation, advising HR, drafting policies)\n- **Employee-side** (plaintiff's work — discrimination, wage/hour, wrongful termination)\n- **Transactional/compliance** (employment aspects of M&A, executive comp, handbooks, restrictive covenants)\n- **Government/regulatory** (NLRB, EEOC, DOL enforcement)\n\nThese overlap but require different skill sets and resources.\n\n**3. What's your timeline?**\n- Days (client meeting next week)?\n- Weeks (new matter, need to get competent fast)?\n- Months (deliberate practice area build)?\n\n**4. What's your baseline?**\n- Completely new — haven't touched it since law school?\n- Some exposure from adjacent work (e.g., you've handled employment clauses in M&A deals, or defended a single EEOC charge)?\n- Familiar with the basics but need to go deeper in a specific area?\n\n**5. Jurisdiction?**\nFederal law is the floor, but state employment law varies enormously — California, New York, and Illinois, for example, are dramatically more employee-friendly than federal law and have their own compliance regimes. If you're in a specific state, that shapes the curriculum significantly.\n\n---\n\nThe more specific you can be, the more targeted I can make this. Even a sentence or two on each of these gets me most of the way there."
