What's driving this?**\n- New client matter (and if so, what kind — wrongful termination claim, wage dispute, harassment investigation, employment contracts, something else)?\n- Expanding your practice to serve employer clients? Employee-side plaintiffs' work?\n- Lateral move or firm transition?\n\n**2. What's your timeline?**\n- Do you need to be functional in days (active matter), or do you have weeks/months to build real depth?\n\n**3. What's your baseline?**\n- Completely new — never touched it since law school?\n- Some exposure (e.g., you've reviewed employment agreements in transactional work, handled a one-off matter)?\n- Familiar with one side (say, management-side) but moving to the other?\n\n**4. What jurisdiction(s)?**\n- Federal law only, or a specific state (California employment law, for example, is its own universe)?\n- Multi-state employer work?\n\n**5. What will you actually be *doing*?**\n- Advising employers on compliance and policies?\n- Litigating claims?\n- Drafting agreements and handbooks?\n- Conducting internal investigations?\n- M&A due diligence on workforce issues?\n\n---\n\nEmployment law is a broad field — federal statutes alone include Title VII, the ADEA, the ADA, the FMLA, the FLSA, the NLRA, and more, each with its own doctrine and practice patterns. The right curriculum for a litigator defending discrimination claims looks very different from the one for a transactional lawyer advising on workforce restructuring.\n\nTell me what you're actually trying to do and I'll build you something targeted."
