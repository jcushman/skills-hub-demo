This affects whether I emphasize the procedural/tactical side or the business development/positioning side.\n\n2. **Timeline?** Do you have a specific matter or opportunity driving this, or is this a longer-term build over months?\n\n3. **Litigation baseline?** Have you done any civil litigation work — even in other areas? Or is trademark prosecution essentially your entire litigation exposure? (Knowing whether you need to layer in general federal civil procedure or can skip that matters a lot here.)\n\n4. **Prosecution depth?** Since you've been doing prosecution for a couple years, I'll assume solid familiarity with the TTAB, likelihood of confusion analysis, the Lanham Act basics, and the prosecution lifecycle. Anything you feel notably weak on within prosecution that might affect the litigation curriculum?\n\n5. **Scope?** Any particular flavor of trademark litigation you're most interested in — infringement/counterfeiting, TTAB inter partes proceedings (oppositions/cancellations), domain name disputes (UDRP), or all of the above?\n\nThe answers will let me calibrate whether this is a \"get ready for a matter in six weeks\" curriculum or a \"build a litigation practice over a year\" curriculum — very different documents."

Knowing whether there's a deadline shaping this changes the prioritization significantly.\n\n2. **Timeline?** Weeks, a few months, or is this a longer-term build?\n\n3. **Civil litigation background?** Have you handled any federal court litigation in other areas — even as a junior associate doing discovery or briefing? Or is your litigation exposure essentially zero outside of prosecution? This determines whether I need to build in federal civil procedure resources or can assume you have that foundation.\n\n4. **Scope priority?** Given that you've never done either TTAB proceedings or federal court Lanham Act work, which is the higher priority — or do you want both covered in parallel? TTAB inter partes is a natural bridge from prosecution; federal court litigation is a bigger jump but higher stakes. Some attorneys build toward federal court by starting with TTAB oppositions and cancellations.\n\n5. **Firm context?** Solo/small firm, mid-size, BigLaw? This affects what resources you have access to (Westlaw/Lexis practice guides, PLI, etc.) and whether you'll be handling matters independently or with supervision.\n\nThe TTAB-to-federal-court progression is a natural one given your prosecution background — I want to make sure the curriculum reflects your actual path."
