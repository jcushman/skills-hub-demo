What's the general nature of the client's situation?\n\n2. **Who's the client?** Plan sponsor/employer, plan participant, fiduciary, service provider, or someone else? This shapes which parts of ERISA you need to understand first.\n\n3. **What do you need to accomplish in 4 days?** Is the goal to (a) get oriented enough to have an intelligent intake call and identify the right questions, (b) actually advise on the merits, or (c) decide whether to refer out or bring in co-counsel?\n\n4. **Any adjacent familiarity?** Have you touched benefits issues in employment work, M&A due diligence, or litigation? Or is this truly a cold start?\n\nThe answers will let me give you a tight, prioritized curriculum rather than a survey of all of ERISA — which would take weeks and won't help you in 4 days."
