What's the client's situation?\n\n2. **Who's the client?** Plan sponsor/employer, plan participant, fiduciary, service provider, or someone else?\n\n3. **Any sense of the core issue?** For example: denied benefits claim, fiduciary liability exposure, plan compliance problem, withdrawal liability, executive compensation (top-hat plans), or something else?\n\n4. **Your background:** Any exposure to employee benefits, tax, or labor law, or are you starting from zero?\n\nThe answers will let me cut the curriculum down to what actually matters for your call — 4 days is tight, and you don't want to spend it learning ERISA preemption doctrine if your client has a 401(k) fiduciary problem."
