I want to explain what this means and outline our path forward.*\n\n*The court's ruling focused on a factual dispute regarding the timeline of events, finding that this dispute must be resolved at trial rather than decided as a matter of law. While I believe our arguments were well-supported, the ruling is not uncommon in cases involving contested facts.*\n\n*We have several options to consider, including a motion for reconsideration, proceeding to trial, or exploring settlement. I'd like to schedule a call this week to discuss each option and your priorities.*\n\n*Please let me know your availability.*\n\n---\n\n**Would you like help drafting talking points for the follow-up call?**"

      "content": "That's exactly the right tension to navigate. Here's a framework for thinking about it:\n\n## The Core Balance\n\n**Honesty requires you to:**\n- Acknowledge this is a real setback\n- Give him an accurate picture of what the ruling means\n- Not oversell reconsideration prospects if they're genuinely limited\n\n**Avoiding defeatism means:**\n- Distinguishing between losing the motion and losing the case\n- Presenting options as genuine choices, not formalities\n- Demonstrating you're still engaged and strategic\n\n---\n\n## A Practical Reframe\n\nSummary judgment denial is actually a **neutral legal fact** in one important sense - it means the case proceeds, not that you've lost. That's honest and not spin.\n\nWhat you want to avoid is:\n- False optimism that sets up a worse conversation later\n- Language that sounds like you're already mentally at settlement\n- Anything that makes him feel the investment was wasted\n\n---\n\n## For the Email Specifically\n\nConsider leading with **what remains possible** rather than what was lost, while still being direct about the setback.\n\n**One honest framing:**\n*\"This ruling means we go to trial rather than resolving the case now. That changes our timeline and costs, and I want to talk through what that means for your goals.\"*\n\n---\n\n## My Honest Suggestion\n\n**The email should be brief.** The real conversation needs to happen by phone where you can read his reactions and answer questions directly.\n\nWould you like help preparing for that call specifically?"
