While I believed our arguments were strong, the court's ruling means we now have two primary options to consider: proceeding to trial or exploring settlement discussions.*\n\n*I'd like to speak with you directly to walk through both paths, including my honest assessment of each. Could you make time for a call [specific day/time options]?*\n\n*I remain committed to achieving the best possible outcome for you.*\n\n*Sincerely, [Name]\"*\n\n---\n\n## Why This Works Better\n\n- Acknowledges his investment **without dwelling on it**\n- Explains the ruling **without criticizing the judge**\n- Positions trial as a **viable path**, not a consolation prize\n- Reserves your detailed assessment **for the call**, where tone is easier to manage\n\nThe harder conversation is the phone call.
