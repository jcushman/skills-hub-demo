      "content": "Before I dive in, a couple of quick questions that will sharpen the feedback:\n\n1. **What's the deal?** (Acquisition, financing, real estate, etc. — just the type)\n2. **What's the relationship?** (New client, long-standing, is Sarah the GC, a founder, board member?)\n3. **What prompted this email?** (Routine update, or did Sarah reach out with concerns?)\n\nThat said, the draft is short enough that I can give you useful feedback now, with the caveat that some of it may shift depending on context.\n\n---\n\n## Feedback\n\n### The Lead Is Doing Too Little Work\n\n> *\"The deal is moving forward.\"*\n\nThis is the most important sentence in the email, and it's doing the least work. \"Moving forward\" is filler — it tells Sarah almost nothing. Moving forward *from where*? What happened since the last update?\n\n**Rewrite:** Lead with the actual development. If something specific happened — a condition was satisfied, a party signed off, a sticking point resolved — say that. *\"The lender approved the revised term sheet this morning\"* is a sentence. *\"The deal is moving forward\"* is not.\n\n---\n\n### \"If All Goes Well\" Is a Problem\n\n> *\"We should close by end of month if all goes well.\"*\n\nThis phrase is doing double duty as a hedge and as a confidence signal — and it fails at both. As a hedge, it's too vague to protect you. As a confidence signal, it undermines the message. The client reads: *\"My lawyer isn't sure.\"*\n\nIf there are specific conditions that need to be met before closing, name them. If there aren't, drop the qualifier.\n\n**Option A (conditions exist):** *\"We're on track to close by month-end, assuming the title search clears and the other side returns executed docs by Friday.\"*\n\n**Option B (no real conditions):** *\"We're on track to close by month-end.\"*\n\n---\n\n### \"Revised Docs\" — Which Ones?\n\n> *\"I'll send the revised docs tomorrow.\"*\n\nSarah may be tracking multiple documents. \"The revised docs\" assumes she knows exactly what you mean. In a deal context, that's often a safe assumption — but if there's any ambiguity, name them. *\"I'll send the revised purchase agreement and disclosure schedules tomorrow\"* takes three extra seconds to write and eliminates a follow-up email.\n\n---\n\n### The Board Question Is Dangling\n\n> *\"Let me know if the board has any concerns.\"*\n\nThis is a reasonable thing to say, but it's passive and slightly awkward as a closing. A few issues:\n\n- It implies the board *might* have concerns you're not aware of — which could plant anxiety if there's nothing to worry about.\n- It puts the burden entirely on Sarah without giving her anything to work with.\n\n**Better approach:** If board approval is a live issue, address it directly. *\"Does the board need anything from us before the vote on Thursday?\"* is more useful than a general invitation to raise concerns.\n\nIf it's not a live issue, cut it.\n\n---\n\n### What's Missing: Next Steps With Ownership\n\nThe email mentions one action item (docs tomorrow) but doesn't tell Sarah what, if anything, she needs to do. Clients want to know: *Am I waiting on you, or are you waiting on me?*\n\nAdd a clear line: *\"On your end, the only thing we need before closing is [X] by [date].\"* Or if nothing is needed: *\"Nothing needed from you right now — I'll be in touch once the docs are ready for review.\"*\n\n---\n\n## The Pattern Here\n\n**You're writing for yourself, not for Sarah.** The email reflects what you know and what you're doing. It doesn't tell Sarah what she needs to know to feel informed and confident. Client status updates should answer three questions: *Where do things stand? What happens next? What do you need from me?* This email answers the first question vaguely and the other two not at all.\n\n---\n\n## One Principle to Take Forward\n\n**In deal status emails, lead with the development, close with the action.** The middle can have context. But if a client has to read to the end to find out what happened or what they need to do, the structure is backwards. Sarah is probably busy; make the email work for her, not for you.\n\n---\n\nHappy to look at a revised draft once you have context to add, or to work through a rewrite together."
