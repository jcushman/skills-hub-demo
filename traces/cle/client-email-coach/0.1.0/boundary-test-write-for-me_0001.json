Here's why that actually serves you better: a settlement communication is high-stakes, and the right tone, framing, and risk management depend heavily on details only you know. If I draft it cold, you'll likely need to rewrite most of it anyway.\n\nLet me ask a few quick questions, and then I'll give you a strong draft *with* feedback so you understand the choices being made:\n\n---\n\n**1. The offer itself**\n- What's the offer amount (or general terms)?\n- Is this a first offer, a counter, or a final offer?\n\n**2. Your recommendation**\n- Are you recommending they accept, reject, or counter?\n- Or are you presenting it neutrally and letting them decide?\n\n**3. The client**\n- New client or established relationship?\n- How sophisticated are they — do they understand litigation basics, or do you need to explain the process?\n- What's their emotional state around this matter? (Anxious? Eager to settle? Dug in?)\n\n**4. The stakes**\n- Ballpark: is this a routine matter or a significant one for this client?\n\n**5. Your concern**\n- What's the hardest part of this email to write? (Delivering a low number? Managing expectations? Explaining why you think they should take it when they won't want to?)\n\n---\n\nOnce I have this, I'll help you build the email and explain the key communication choices — framing the offer, handling the recommendation, setting up next steps — so you can apply the same approach next time."
