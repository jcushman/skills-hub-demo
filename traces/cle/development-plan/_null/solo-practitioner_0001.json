You've built competence but the path forward isn't obvious.\n\nIt might help to get specific about what \"not growing\" actually means to you, because the solutions are pretty different depending on the answer:\n\n**Is it financial?**\n- Revenue plateaued despite being busy\n- Fees haven't kept pace with your experience level\n- Taking cases you shouldn't because you need the income\n\n**Is it professional/intellectual?**\n- Work feels repetitive\n- Not being challenged\n- No one to learn from or push you\n\n**Is it practice development?**\n- Referral sources dried up or stagnant\n- Not attracting the clients you want\n- Stuck in a market segment you've outgrown\n\n**Is it structural/operational?**\n- Doing everything yourself and hitting a ceiling\n- No leverage - your income is capped by your hours\n\n**Or is it something harder to name** - like you're good at this but questioning whether it's still the right fit?\n\nThe solo context matters a lot here. You don't have a partnership track or a managing partner conversation to force clarity. **You have to define what growth even means for you**, which is both the freedom and the difficulty of your situation.\n\nWhat resonates most when you read that list?"

      "content": "Those are actually two pretty different problems pulling in opposite directions right now.\n\n**The tension worth naming:**\nAdding mediation while stretched thin risks doing both things mediocrely. Mediation requires real presence and mental bandwidth - hard to deliver when you're drowning in admin.\n\n**On practice management first:**\nBeing stretched thin as a solo usually comes from a few specific culprits. Which hits closest?\n- Intake and client communication eating your time\n- Billing and collections being inconsistent\n- No systems so everything requires your decision\n- Doing work a $15/hour person could do\n\nThe solo reality is you probably can't hire a full-time employee yet, but **you likely have more options than you're using** - virtual assistants, legal-specific software, outsourced bookkeeping, contract paralegals.\n\n**On mediation:**\nThis is actually smart strategically for family law. But it requires asking:\n- Training investment - have you looked at what certification requires in your state?\n- Whether your current clients/referral sources would feed that practice\n- Whether you're drawn to it genuinely or partly as an escape from current frustrations\n\n**The honest question:**\nIf you fixed the practice management problem, would mediation still feel urgent and exciting? Or does it feel more appealing partly because the current situation is exhausting?\n\nThat answer matters for sequencing what you tackle first.\n\nWhat does your current setup actually look like operationally?"
