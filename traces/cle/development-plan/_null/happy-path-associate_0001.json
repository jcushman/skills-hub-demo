Here's what actually matters:\n\n## Build a Foundation Before Chasing Clients\n\n**First, be excellent at your work.** Partners won't advocate for someone who creates problems. Make sure you're known for:\n- Delivering quality work with minimal supervision\n- Meeting deadlines reliably\n- Anticipating issues before they become problems\n\n## Develop Internal Relationships Strategically\n\n- **Identify 2-3 partners** whose practice you want to grow with, not just whoever assigns you work\n- Make yourself genuinely useful to them, not just available\n- Understand their clients' businesses, not just the legal issues\n\n## Start Building External Visibility Now\n\n- Join one or two bar associations or industry groups and **actually participate** - don't just pay dues\n- Write something - articles, client alerts, anything that puts your name out there\n- Reconnect with law school contacts who are now in-house or at companies\n\n## Understand Your Firm's Specific Path\n\nThis is critical and often overlooked:\n- Ask a trusted partner directly what partnership criteria actually look like\n- Understand whether your firm values origination heavily or rewards service partners\n- Know the realistic timeline and what the economics look like\n\n## One Honest Caution\n\nBusiness development at year 3 is about **planting seeds**, not closing clients. Focus on relationships and reputation now. Pressure to originate business immediately often leads to wasted effort.\n\nWhat aspect of this feels most unclear or challenging for you right now?"

      "content": "With only 3-4 hours a month, focus and ruthless prioritization matter more than effort. Here's how to think about it:\n\n## The Hard Truth First\n\n3-4 hours monthly won't build a book of business quickly. But used strategically, it can meaningfully move the needle on **reputation and relationships** - which is what actually converts to clients at your stage.\n\n## Prioritize These Activities in Order\n\n**Highest ROI with limited time:**\n- Deepen relationships with 2-3 existing contacts who could realistically refer work or become clients within 2-3 years\n- Have one genuine coffee or lunch conversation monthly - no pitch, just relationship building\n- Follow up meaningfully when contacts change jobs or have visible professional wins\n\n**Medium ROI:**\n- Write one short client alert or article per quarter - repurpose your existing case work so it doesn't require much extra research\n- Attend one targeted event where your actual potential clients go, not lawyer-heavy events\n\n**Lower ROI for your situation:**\n- Large networking events\n- Bar association committees without client contact\n- Social media presence (unless your clients are actually there)\n\n## A Realistic Monthly Allocation\n\n| Activity | Time |\n|----------|------|\n| One relationship conversation | 1.5 hrs |\n| Follow-up emails/touches | 30 min |\n| Writing or visibility work | 1 hr |\n| Firm internal relationship building | 30 min |\n\n## The Question Worth Asking Your Partner\n\n*\"Which specific clients or prospects would you want me to start building relationships with?\"*\n\nThis does two things - gets you concrete direction and signals you're serious.\n\nWhat does your current network actually look like? That shapes where to start."
