Here's what actually matters:\n\n## Build a Foundation Before Chasing Clients\n\n**First, be excellent at the work.** Partners won't champion someone who creates problems. Make sure your reputation internally is solid before investing heavily in external BD.\n\n---\n\n## What Actually Moves the Needle\n\n**Develop a genuine specialty**\n- Pick 1-2 practice areas and become the person people call\n- Generalists rarely make partner at competitive firms\n- Follow where the firm's growth opportunities are\n\n**Start building relationships now, not later**\n- Former classmates are becoming in-house counsel and business owners\n- Reconnect authentically, not transactionally\n- These relationships take 5-7 years to generate work\n\n**Understand your firm's partnership criteria specifically**\n- Ask a trusted partner directly what they look for\n- Origination requirements vary enormously by firm\n- Know the actual target before optimizing for it\n\n---\n\n## Practical Near-Term Actions\n\n- Write articles or speak at events in your specialty area\n- Join 1-2 bar associations or industry groups and actually participate\n- Ask to be on client calls and pitches whenever possible\n- Develop relationships with clients you already serve\n\n---\n\n## One Honest Caution\n\n**Have a direct conversation with a mentor partner** about your trajectory. Firms vary hugely in whether associates realistically make partner, and you want honest feedback now rather than at year 6.\n\nWhat practice area are you in? That would help me give more specific advice."

      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "3-4 hours is actually workable if you're strategic. The mistake most associates make is spreading that time too thin.\n\n## Reframe the Constraint\n\n**Don't try to do \"BD\" broadly.** With limited time, you need activities that compound - meaning they build relationships AND reputation simultaneously.\n\n---\n\n## How I'd Allocate 3-4 Hours Monthly\n\n**~1.5 hours: One substantive touchpoint with your network**\n- Coffee, lunch, or even a quick call with a former classmate or contact\n- Focus on people moving into roles where they'll need outside counsel in 2-3 years\n- One genuine conversation beats ten LinkedIn likes\n\n**~1 hour: One piece of visible content**\n- Short LinkedIn post on a case or legal development in your area\n- Email update to clients about relevant legal changes\n- This builds reputation passively over time\n\n**~30 min: Internal relationship building**\n- Lunch with a partner in a complementary practice\n- Cross-referrals matter enormously at mid-size firms\n\n**~30 min: Track and follow up**\n- Keep a simple spreadsheet of contacts and last touchpoint\n- BD dies from neglect, not lack of effort\n\n---\n\n## The Honest Reality\n\nYour supervising partner's feedback is important signal. I'd push back gently on one thing though:\n\n**Ask them specifically what \"managing client relationships more independently\" looks like in practice.** That's vague feedback that could mean very different things, and clarifying it is itself a partnership-track behavior.\n\nWhat does your current network look like - law school contacts, former clients, industry connections?"
