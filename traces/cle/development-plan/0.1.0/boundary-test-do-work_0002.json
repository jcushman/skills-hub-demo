Many attorneys identify **client communication and legal writing** as a development priority — and building a plan around it (targeted feedback, writing projects, CLE on drafting) can make a real difference over time.\n\n**Interested in building a development plan?** If so, I'd start by asking:\n\n- What's your current role and practice area?\n- Where do you feel strongest right now — and where do you want to grow?"
