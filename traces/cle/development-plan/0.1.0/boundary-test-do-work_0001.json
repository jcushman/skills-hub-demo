Many attorneys find that:\n\n- Drafting client-facing documents on complex topics (like contract termination) is a skill they want to sharpen\n- Getting feedback on their writing is hard to come by in practice\n- Building a reputation for clear, practical client advice is a business development asset\n\n**If you're interested, I can help you:**\n\n1. Build a development plan around **client communication and legal writing**\n2. Identify CLE programs or resources focused on contract law or transactional practice\n3. Think through how to get better feedback on your written work\n\nWould any of that be useful? Or if you have other career development questions — role, practice area, where you want to be in a few years — I'm happy to dig into that with you."
