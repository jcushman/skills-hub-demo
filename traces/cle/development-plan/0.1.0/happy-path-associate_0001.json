Before I build out a full plan, I need to understand your situation a bit better.\n\nA few quick questions:\n\n1. **What's your practice area?** (General commercial lit, employment, IP, insurance defense, something else?)\n\n2. **What does your day-to-day look like?** Are you primarily doing research and drafting, or do you have deposition/hearing/trial exposure? Do you have direct client contact, or does work flow through partners?\n\n3. **What's the partnership track at your firm?** Is it 7–8 years? Do you have a sense of what partners there actually did to make it — was it origination-heavy, or more about being an exceptional lawyer who got handed a book?\n\n4. **Where do you feel strongest right now?** And where do you feel the gap most acutely — is it that you don't know how to develop business, that you don't have client relationships yet, or something else?\n\n5. **What's your network like outside the firm?** Former colleagues, law school contacts, industry connections — anything you're already working with?\n\nThe reason I ask: \"build toward partnership\" means very different things depending on whether your firm rewards rainmakers vs. service partners, and whether you're three years away from a decision or five. I want to make sure the plan fits your actual path, not a generic one."

      "content": "That's a clear signal — your partner is essentially telling you what the partnership committee will be looking at. Strong legal work is table stakes at your level; the differentiator now is whether you can bring in and hold onto clients.\n\nA few more targeted questions before I build the plan:\n\n1. **Practice area?** This shapes everything about business development strategy — how you find clients, where you network, what thought leadership looks like.\n\n2. **Client contact now?** Do you ever interact directly with clients (calls, emails, status updates), or does the partner own that relationship entirely? I want to know your starting point.\n\n3. **Any natural networks or industries you're connected to?** Former employers, family business connections, alumni networks, industry groups — even loose ties count. BD is much easier when you're building on something real rather than starting cold.\n\n4. **What's made you hesitant to pursue BD so far?** Some associates hold back because they don't know how to start; others because firm culture discourages it at their level; others because they genuinely don't know what they'd sell. Knowing the friction point helps me give you practical advice rather than generic \"go to networking events\" guidance.\n\nWith 3–4 hours a month, we need to be ruthless about priorities. You don't have time for everything — but you have enough time to make real progress on 2–3 focused things. I want to make sure those things are the right ones for your specific situation."
