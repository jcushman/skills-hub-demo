That's a good problem to have, but it does need a deliberate response.\n\nBefore I build a plan, let me ask a few targeted questions:\n\n**On the \"stuck\" feeling:**\n- When you say not growing — is it more about *skills* (you want to be better at something specific), *business* (revenue, client base, reputation), or *satisfaction* (the work doesn't feel meaningful or challenging)?\n\n**On your practice:**\n- What's your current mix? (Divorce, custody, support, domestic violence, adoption, etc.)\n- Do you have a niche, or are you a general family law practitioner?\n- Are you at capacity, or do you have room to take more work?\n\n**On where you want to go:**\n- If your practice looked exactly right in 3 years, what would be different from today?\n- Is there anything you've been wanting to do but keep deprioritizing — a type of case, a skill, a reputation you want to build?\n\nYou don't have to answer all of these in order. Even a rough answer to \"what would different look like\" is a useful starting point."

      "content": "Two clear priorities — and they're actually related. Being stretched thin is partly a practice management problem, and solving it creates the bandwidth to build the mediation side. Let's address both.\n\nA few more questions to make the plan concrete:\n\n**On mediation:**\n- Are you thinking family mediation as a neutral (a separate revenue stream, mediating other people's cases), or using mediation skills in your own cases, or both?\n- Have you done any mediation training yet, or is this starting from zero?\n- Do you have a timeline in mind — is this a \"this year\" goal or a \"2-3 year\" build?\n\n**On practice management:**\n- Where does the time go? What tasks eat your day that shouldn't require you specifically? (Billing, scheduling, document drafting, client intake, court filings?)\n- Do you have any support staff or contractors, or are you truly solo?\n- What does your current tech stack look like? (Practice management software, billing system, document automation — or mostly manual?)\n\n**One framing question:**\n- When you imagine having this figured out in 3 years — are you still a solo, or have you grown into something bigger? Some solos want to stay lean and efficient; others want to build a small firm. That changes the plan significantly.\n\nThe answers will tell me whether we're solving a systems problem, a delegation problem, a technology problem, or some combination. Take a shot at whichever of these you can answer most easily."
