Here's how I'd suggest we use this time:\n\n---\n\n**What would actually be useful right now?**\n\n1. **Sharpen your analytical framework** — Walk me through the grounds you're considering (12(b)(6) failure to state a claim? Jurisdiction? Standing? Something else?). I'll push back on your reasoning the way a skeptical judge would, so you stress-test the argument before you commit to paper.\n\n2. **Structure and persuasion coaching** — If you have a draft or an outline, I can give you candid feedback on organization, the strength of your opening, how you're handling adverse authority, and whether your argument is actually moving toward dismissal or just reciting law.\n\n3. **Learning a new ground or doctrine** — If there's a legal theory here you haven't litigated before (say, Twombly/Iqbal pleading standards, or a specific jurisdictional argument), I can walk you through how experienced practitioners approach it and what courts actually respond to.\n\n4. **Anticipating the opposition** — We can work through how plaintiff's counsel will likely respond and whether your argument survives that.\n\n---\n\n**Where are you in the process?** Do you have a draft, an outline, or are you still at the \"figuring out the grounds\" stage? And what's the underlying case about?"
