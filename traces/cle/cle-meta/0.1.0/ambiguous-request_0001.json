A few directions this could go:\n\n---\n\n**Craft** — Are you struggling with something specific? Depositions, drafting, oral argument, negotiation, managing complex matters?\n\n**Client relationships** — Communication, expectation-setting, difficult clients, business development?\n\n**Practice management** — Efficiency, delegation, systems, work-life sustainability?\n\n**Career trajectory** — Moving into a new practice area, making partner, going in-house, building a book of business?\n\n**Judgment** — The harder-to-name stuff: knowing when to push, when to settle, how to read a room, how to advise under uncertainty?\n\n---\n\nHere's a useful diagnostic: **Think about the last time you felt like you underperformed.** Not a bad outcome — outcomes are often outside your control — but a moment where you walked away thinking *I could have handled that better.*\n\nWhat was it? That's usually where the real development work is.\n\nWhat comes to mind?"
