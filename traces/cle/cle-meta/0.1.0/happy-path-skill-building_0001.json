It's to give the client what they need to make a decision or take action.\n\nMost technical overcommunication comes from a good instinct — thoroughness, precision, wanting to be accurate — applied in the wrong direction. You're writing for a lawyer reader when you have a non-lawyer reader.\n\n**One immediate exercise**: Take your last three client emails. For each one, ask: *What did I need the client to do or understand after reading this?* Then ask: *Would they know that from reading it?*\n\nWhat does that surface for you?"

      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "That changes the picture significantly. A GC at a tech company is not a lay client — they're sophisticated, busy, and almost certainly legally trained. \"Too technical\" from them rarely means they don't understand the law.\n\n**What it usually means from a GC:**\n\n- You're giving them lawyer analysis when they need business framing\n- They have to extract the \"so what\" themselves\n- Your updates feel like memos to a partner, not briefings to an executive\n- You're hedging in ways that feel like you're covering yourself rather than advising them\n\nGCs are managing up to a CEO and board. They need to be able to take your communication and use it — in a meeting, in a budget conversation, in a risk discussion with leadership. If they can't do that easily, you're creating work for them.\n\n---\n\n**The specific shift for patent litigation:**\n\nYou're probably excellent at claim construction nuance, prosecution history estoppel, damages methodologies. That expertise is real and they're paying for it. But the GC's actual questions are usually:\n\n- Are we going to win?\n- How much is this going to cost?\n- Should we settle?\n- What's the business risk if we lose?\n\n**A practical reframe to try:**\n\nStructure every substantive client communication — email, call, status update — with this hierarchy:\n\n1. **Bottom line first**: The answer, recommendation, or key development in one or two sentences\n2. **Business implication**: What this means for them operationally or financially\n3. **Legal basis**: Abbreviated — enough to show your reasoning, not a full analysis\n4. **Action needed**: What you need from them, if anything\n\nMost litigators write this in reverse order.\n\n---\n\n**Before you do anything else:**\n\nCan you get more specific feedback from the GC directly? Something like:\n\n*\"I really value your feedback and want to make sure I'm giving you what's most useful. Can you point me to a specific communication that didn't land well so I understand exactly what you're looking for?\"*\n\nThat conversation itself is a skill worth developing — and it will tell you more than any general advice I can give you. Have you had that conversation yet?"
