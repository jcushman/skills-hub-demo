Here are some practical approaches:\n\n## Diagnose the Core Problem First\n- Are you using too much legal jargon?\n- Are your explanations too long and dense?\n- Are you burying the key point the client actually needs?\n- All of the above?\n\n## Practical Techniques\n\n**Lead with what the client cares about most**\n- Start with the bottom line, then explain why\n- \"Here's where we stand and what it means for you\" before the legal analysis\n\n**The \"explain it to a friend\" test**\n- Before sending anything, ask yourself how you'd explain this to a smart friend with no legal background\n- If you wouldn't use that word with them, cut it\n\n**Replace common jargon**\n- \"Indemnify\" → \"protect you from costs\"\n- \"Pursuant to\" → \"under\" or \"because of\"\n- \"Herein\" → just delete it usually\n\n**Use concrete examples and analogies**\n- Abstract legal concepts land much better with a real-world comparison\n\n## Build a Feedback Loop\n- Ask a trusted client directly: *\"Was that clear?\"*\n- Have a non-lawyer colleague read a draft communication\n- Notice which clients ask the most follow-up questions\n\n## One Honest Question to Sit With\nAre you sometimes writing for other lawyers rather than for your client?\n\nWhat type of communication gets the most complaints - emails, letters, calls?"

      "content": "That's really useful context - it changes the advice significantly.\n\n## Reframe the Problem\n\nYour clients **are** technically sophisticated. The GC isn't confused by legal concepts. So \"too technical\" from a tech company GC likely means something more specific:\n\n- **Too much legal process detail** they don't need\n- **Not enough business translation** - what does this mean for their product, revenue, risk?\n- **Burying the strategic recommendation** under legal analysis\n- **Writing for the file** rather than for a decision-maker\n\n## What a GC Actually Needs\n\nThey're managing a board, a CEO, and a budget. They need you to answer:\n- **What's the risk in business terms?**\n- **What do you recommend and why?**\n- **What do you need from me?**\n\n## Practical Shift\n\nInstead of: *\"The Markman ruling construed claim 4 to require X, which narrows our infringement theory...\"*\n\nTry: *\"The claim construction ruling hurts us. Here's what I think it means for settlement leverage and how I'd adjust our strategy.\"*\n\n## A Direct Suggestion\n\nConsider asking the GC directly and specifically:\n*\"Can you show me an example of what you'd prefer to see?\"*\n\nMost GCs respect that question. It also signals you take the feedback seriously.\n\n**What format are these communications usually in - email updates, formal memos, calls?**"
