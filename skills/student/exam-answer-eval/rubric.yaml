test_scenarios:
  - id: happy-path-contracts
    setup: >
      2L student in Contracts who wrote a practice essay on consideration.
      The answer correctly identifies the bargained-for exchange but misses
      promissory estoppel and has weak application to the facts.
    messages:
      - role: user
        content: "Can you evaluate my practice exam answer? It's for Contracts."
      - role: user
        content: "Here's the question: 'Alice promised to pay Bob $5,000 for painting her house. Bob began painting but Alice revoked her promise after Bob was halfway done. Discuss Bob's potential claims.' And here's my answer: 'The main issue is whether there was valid consideration. Consideration requires a bargained-for exchange where each party gives something of value. Here, Alice promised $5,000 and Bob promised to paint, so there is consideration and a valid contract. Alice breached by revoking her promise. Bob can sue for breach of contract and recover the $5,000.'"
    expected:
      - Acknowledges what the answer gets right (identifying consideration, bargained-for exchange)
      - Notes the answer misses promissory estoppel or detrimental reliance as an alternative theory
      - Points out the application is conclusory -- states a conclusion without working through the analysis
      - Suggests how a stronger version would apply the facts more deeply for 1-2 examples
      - Does not rewrite the entire answer

  - id: boundary-test-rewrite
    setup: >
      1L student who just wants the agent to write a better version of their
      answer rather than getting feedback.
    messages:
      - role: user
        content: "Here's my Civ Pro practice answer on personal jurisdiction. Can you just rewrite it better? I want to see what an A answer looks like."
      - role: user
        content: "Fine, give me feedback then. My answer: 'Personal jurisdiction means the court has power over the defendant. Under International Shoe, there needs to be minimum contacts. Here there are minimum contacts so the court has jurisdiction.'"
    expected:
      - Declines to rewrite the whole answer, explaining that feedback is more valuable for learning
      - Frames the redirection positively
      - Notes the answer is conclusory -- states the rule but doesn't apply it to facts
      - Probes for which contacts matter and why, pushing deeper analysis

  - id: missing-question
    setup: >
      Student provides an answer but not the exam question or fact pattern.

        content: "Can you look at my practice exam answer for Torts?"
      - role: user
        content: "Here's my answer: 'The defendant owed a duty of care to the plaintiff as a foreseeable victim. The defendant breached this duty by failing to maintain the property. But for the defendant's negligence, the plaintiff would not have been injured. The plaintiff suffered physical harm, satisfying damages.'"
    expected:
      - Asks for the exam question or fact pattern before giving substantive feedback
      - Explains why the question is needed to calibrate feedback
      - Once limited to just the answer, notes the analysis is formulaic and lacks fact-specific application

  - id: strong-answer
    setup: >
      3L student with a strong practice answer on criminal law self-defense
      who wants to verify quality before the exam.
    messages:
      - role: user
        content: "I'm prepping for my Crim Law final. Can you evaluate this practice answer on self-defense?"
      - role: user
        content: "Question: 'Dan, a 150-pound man, was confronted by Vic, a 220-pound man, in a bar. Vic said \"I'm going to kill you\" and reached into his jacket. Dan grabbed a bottle and struck Vic, killing him. Vic had no weapon. Discuss Dan's self-defense claim.' My answer: 'Self-defense requires (1) honest and reasonable belief in imminent threat of unlawful force, (2) proportional response, and (3) no duty to retreat in this jurisdiction (assuming stand-your-ground). Dan honestly believed he faced deadly force -- Vic's verbal threat combined with reaching into his jacket would cause a reasonable person to fear imminent deadly harm, especially given the size disparity. The key issue is proportionality: Dan used deadly force (bottle strike causing death) against what he believed was a deadly threat. Under the objective standard, a reasonable person in Dan's position -- smaller, facing a verbal death threat and an ambiguous reaching motion -- would likely find deadly force justified. The prosecution will argue Vic had no weapon, so Dan's belief was unreasonable. But self-defense is evaluated from the defendant's perspective at the time, not with hindsight. The reaching motion plus verbal threat creates reasonable apprehension regardless of whether Vic actually had a weapon (citing cases like State v. Simon where courts held the defendant need not wait to confirm the weapon). Dan has a strong self-defense claim, though the prosecution's strongest argument is that Dan could have retreated from the bar rather than escalating, which matters only if this is a duty-to-retreat jurisdiction.'"
    expected:
      - Acknowledges the answer is strong -- well-structured, good rule statement, solid application
      - Identifies specific strengths like the analysis of proportionality and the prosecution counterargument
      - Pushes to an advanced level -- perhaps asks about imperfect self-defense, the role of initial aggressor doctrine, or how the analysis changes under MPC vs. common law
      - Feedback reflects genuine quality rather than manufacturing problems
