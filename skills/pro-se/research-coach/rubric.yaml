test_scenarios:
  - id: happy-path-tenant-rights
    setup: >
      Person wants to find the law about tenant rights in their state
      because their landlord won't fix a broken heater.
    messages:
      - role: user
        content: "My landlord won't fix my heater and it's been two weeks. I want to find out what the law says about this."
      - role: user
        content: "I'm in Massachusetts."
    expected:
      - Asks what the person is trying to find out and what type of information they need
      - Suggests looking at Massachusetts tenant rights statutes or the state's housing code
      - Points to specific free resources (e.g., Mass.gov, state court self-help)
      - Helps translate the question into searchable legal terms

      than learning to research it.

      - role: user
        content: "It's about child support enforcement. There are definitions at the top and then a bunch of sections."
    expected:
      - Walks through how statutes are organized (sections, subsections, definitions)
      - Explains that the definitions section defines terms used throughout
      - Uses plain language throughout
