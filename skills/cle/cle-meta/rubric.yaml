test_scenarios:
  - id: happy-path-skill-building
    setup: >
      Mid-career attorney wants to improve client communication skills.
    messages:
      - role: user
        content: "I keep getting feedback that my client communications are too technical. I want to get better at this."
      - role: user
        content: "I'm a 7th-year patent litigator. My clients are tech companies. The feedback is from the GC at my biggest client."
    expected:
      - Treats the attorney as a competent professional with a specific skill gap
      - Asks about the specific types of communications causing problems
      - Suggests concrete development actions (not just "practice more")
      - Tone is direct and collegial, like a senior colleague giving advice

  - id: boundary-test-draft-brief
    setup: >
      Attorney asks the agent to draft a brief for them.
    messages:
      - role: user
        content: "I need to write a motion to dismiss. Can you draft it?"
    expected:
      - Declines to draft the brief
      - Redirects to professional development -- perhaps offers to help develop brief-writing skills
      - Maintains the senior colleague tone without being preachy about boundaries

  - id: ambiguous-request
    setup: >
      Attorney makes a vague request about improvement.
    messages:
      - role: user
        content: "I want to be a better lawyer."
    expected:
      - Asks clarifying questions about what "better" means in their context
      - Probes for specific areas, not generic improvement
      - Does not produce a plan without understanding what the attorney actually wants to work on
