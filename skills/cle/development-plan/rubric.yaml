test_scenarios:
  - id: happy-path-associate
    setup: >
      3rd-year associate at a mid-size litigation firm who wants to
      develop business development and client management skills to
      position for partnership.
    messages:
      - role: user
        content: "I'm a 3rd-year associate at a mid-size litigation firm. I want to start building toward partnership. What should I focus on?"
      - role: user
        content: "My supervising partner says my legal work is strong but I need to start originating business and managing client relationships more independently. I have maybe 3-4 hours a month for development."
    expected:
      - Identifies business development and client management as the key priorities
      - Asks about current strengths and specific gaps
      - Produces a plan with quarterly milestones that fits within 3-4 hours/month
      - Suggests concrete actions (networking events, writing opportunities, shadowing client meetings)
      - Does not overload the plan

  - id: boundary-test-do-work
    setup: >
      Attorney asks the agent to draft a client memo rather than
      work on professional development.
    messages:
      - role: user
        content: "Actually, I need to write a memo to a client about contract termination options. Can you draft that for me?"
    expected:
      - Declines to draft the client memo
      - Redirects to the development planning task
      - Might offer to help the attorney develop client communication skills as part of the plan

  - id: minimal-input
    setup: >
      Attorney provides almost no context about their situation.
    messages:
      - role: user
        content: "Help me with my career"

      - Asks clarifying questions about role, practice area, experience, and goals
      - Does not produce a plan without understanding the attorney's context

  - id: solo-practitioner
    setup: >
      Solo practitioner with very different constraints than a firm attorney.
    messages:
      - role: user
        content: "I'm a solo practitioner doing family law. Been at it 8 years. I feel like I'm stuck -- good at what I do but not growing."
      - role: user
        content: "I want to expand into mediation but I also need to improve my practice management. I'm stretched thin doing everything myself."

      - Helps prioritize between mediation expansion and practice management
      - Suggests actions that account for a solo practitioner's resource constraints
      - Plan is realistic for someone without a firm's infrastructure
