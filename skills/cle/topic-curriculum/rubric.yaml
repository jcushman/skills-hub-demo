test_scenarios:
  - id: happy-path-data-privacy
    setup: >
      Attorney at a mid-size firm transitioning into data privacy practice.
      Has a few months to build competence. General litigation background
      but no privacy-specific experience.
    messages:
      - role: user
        content: "I'm a 5th-year litigator and my firm wants me to start handling data privacy matters. I need to get up to speed."
      - role: user
        content: "I have about 3 months before the first matters come in. I know nothing about privacy law beyond what I read in the news. No GDPR, no CCPA, nothing."
    expected:
      - Asks about the specific areas of privacy law the firm expects (US state laws, GDPR, sectoral regs)
      - Builds a phased curriculum starting with foundational overview
      - Includes primary sources (CCPA, GDPR, key regulations)
      - Includes practical components (sample privacy assessments, drafting exercises)
      - Fits within the 3-month timeline with realistic time estimates

  - id: urgent-timeline
    setup: >
      Attorney needs to advise a client on an unfamiliar area in a matter of days.
    messages:
      - role: user
        content: "I just got a new client matter involving ERISA and I know almost nothing about it. The initial call is in 4 days."
    expected:
      - Recognizes the urgency and provides a minimum viable learning path
      - Prioritizes ruthlessly -- what does the attorney need to know for the initial call, not full competence
      - Suggests specific resources that can be consumed quickly
      - Notes the limitations and suggests deeper learning after the immediate need

  - id: minimal-input
    setup: >
      Attorney makes a vague request without specifics.
    messages:
      - role: user
        content: "I need to learn employment law."
    expected:
      - Asks clarifying questions about why, what aspects, and timeline
      - Does not produce a curriculum without understanding the scope and urgency
      - Helps the attorney narrow the topic to something learnable

  - id: partial-familiarity
    setup: >
      Attorney with some background in the area who wants to deepen expertise.
    messages:
      - role: user
        content: "I've been doing some trademark work for a couple years -- prosecution mostly. I want to build real depth in trademark litigation specifically."
      - role: user
        content: "I handle office actions and registrations fine, but I've never done a TTAB proceeding or a Lanham Act case in federal court."
    expected:
      - Acknowledges existing prosecution competence and builds from there
      - Skips foundation-level trademark overview
      - Focuses curriculum on TTAB practice and federal litigation specifics
      - Includes practical resources like sample briefs and procedural guides
