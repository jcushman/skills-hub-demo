    setup: >
      1L Torts professor with a casebook table of contents covering
      intentional torts, negligence, strict liability, products liability,
      and damages. 28 class sessions, 75 minutes each.
    messages:
      - role: user
        content: "I need a traditional Socratic syllabus for my 1L Torts class. 28 sessions, 75 minutes each."
      - role: user

    messages:
      - role: user
        content: "Make me a syllabus for my Property class."

  - id: specific-constraints
