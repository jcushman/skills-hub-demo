persona: professor
skill: syllabus-evidence-based

criteria:
  structural:
    - id: analyzes-provided-content
      description: Agent reviews the user's source material before generating the syllabus
      check: Agent references specific elements from the user's provided content (casebook chapters, case names, topic areas) in its analysis or output

    - id: asks-missing-info
      description: Agent asks for missing logistical information needed to build the syllabus
      check: Agent asks about session count, session length, semester duration, or credit hours if not provided by the user

    - id: includes-spiral-markers
      description: Schedule includes explicit spiral return points connecting later sessions to earlier material
      check: At least two sessions in the schedule include a spiral marker or explicit connection back to an earlier session's topic

    - id: includes-scaffolding-levels
      description: Sessions indicate the scaffolding progression across the semester
      check: Schedule includes scaffolding annotations (e.g., "Guided framework" early, "Independent analysis" later) or describes the progression explicitly

    - id: includes-spaced-practice
      description: Schedule includes cumulative practice touchpoints that draw on material from multiple units
      check: At least one session or assignment is labeled as a cumulative problem set, connection class, or diagnostic that spans multiple doctrinal areas

    - id: includes-design-note
      description: Syllabus includes a note explaining the evidence-based design approach for students
      check: Output contains a section explaining that the course uses spaced practice, interleaving, scaffolded complexity, or similar evidence-based techniques

  pedagogical:
    - id: evidence-based-grounding
      description: Design decisions reference or reflect learning science principles rather than just conventional practice
      weight: high

    - id: difficulty-calibrated-pacing
      description: More time is allocated to conceptually dense topics, not just proportional to page count
      weight: high

    - id: transparent-rationale
      description: Pacing choices and revisitation decisions are explained, supporting student metacognition
      weight: medium

    - id: cumulative-assessment
      description: Assessments draw from multiple units rather than testing only the most recent block
      weight: medium

anti_patterns:
  - id: linear-block-design
    description: Agent produces a traditional linear syllabus without spiral returns or spaced practice
    check: Schedule covers each topic once in sequence with no explicit revisitation, interleaving, or cumulative practice

  - id: produces-student-work
    description: Agent produces student-facing work product like study guides or outlines
    check: Agent output includes student-facing materials rather than an instructor's syllabus

  - id: ignores-source-material
    description: Agent generates a syllabus from general knowledge rather than the user's provided content
    check: Syllabus topics and readings do not correspond to the materials the user shared

test_scenarios:
  - id: happy-path-con-law
    setup: >
      Professor wants an evidence-based Con Law syllabus built from their
      casebook. 28 sessions, 75 minutes each. Casebook covers judicial
      review, federalism, separation of powers, due process, equal
      protection, and First Amendment.
    messages:
      - role: user
        content: "I'd like a modern, research-informed syllabus for my Con Law survey. 28 sessions, 75 minutes."
      - role: user
        content: "Casebook TOC: Part I Judicial Review (Ch. 1-2), Part II Federalism & Commerce Clause (Ch. 3-4), Part III Separation of Powers (Ch. 5-6), Part IV Due Process (Ch. 7-8), Part V Equal Protection (Ch. 9-10), Part VI First Amendment (Ch. 11-13)."
    expected:
      - Produces a syllabus that revisits earlier concepts in later contexts (e.g., judicial deference resurfaces across multiple doctrinal areas)
      - Includes spiral markers connecting later sessions to earlier material
      - Allocates more sessions to conceptually dense topics rather than using uniform pacing
      - Includes at least one cumulative practice touchpoint or synthesis session
      - Includes a note on course design explaining the evidence-based approach

  - id: compares-to-traditional
    setup: >
      Professor asks how this approach differs from a traditional syllabus.
    messages:
      - role: user
        content: "I usually teach a traditional block syllabus. Why would I want an evidence-based one? What's different?"
    expected:
      - Explains the key structural differences (spiral vs. linear, spaced practice, scaffolded complexity)
      - Grounds the explanation in learning science, not just preference
      - Respects the professor's existing approach while making the case for evidence-based design
      - Does not dismiss traditional approaches

  - id: minimal-input
    setup: >
      Professor requests a modern syllabus without providing source material.
    messages:
      - role: user
        content: "Build me an evidence-based syllabus for Crim Law."
    expected:
      - Asks for source material (casebook, readings, or topics)
      - Asks for logistical details (sessions, length, credit hours)
      - Does not generate a syllabus without the professor's content
