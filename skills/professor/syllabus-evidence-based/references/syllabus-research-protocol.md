# Syllabus Research Protocol

When the course topic and/or casebook are known, search for existing syllabi
from comparable law school courses before generating the syllabus. This research
informs case selections, doctrinal progression, and session allocation -- it
does not replace the skill's methodology.

## When to Research

Conduct this step whenever you can identify at least one of:
- A specific casebook (title and author)
- A specific course topic (e.g., "Constitutional Law," "Evidence," "Torts")
- A specific law school or professor

If the user has provided only raw text without identifying the course or
casebook, ask before searching.

## Search Strategy

Construct targeted queries using combinations of:
- Course name + "syllabus" (e.g., `"Constitutional Law" syllabus`)
- Casebook author/title + "syllabus" (e.g., `"Chemerinsky Constitutional Law"
  syllabus`)
- Specific law school names + course (e.g., `"Harvard Law" "Torts" syllabus`)
- File type filters where supported (`filetype:pdf syllabus`)
- Law school course catalog and registrar sites (`site:law.harvard.edu`,
  `site:law.yale.edu`, `site:law.stanford.edu`)

Search broadly first, then narrow. Aim to find **3-5 usable syllabi** from
different institutions or professors to identify patterns rather than copying
any single source.

## Ranking and Preference Criteria

When multiple syllabi are available, prefer them in this order:

### Tier 1: Closest Match
1. **Same casebook, same course, same institution** -- the most directly
   comparable syllabus
2. **Same casebook, same course, different institution** -- confirms canonical
   case selections and progression for that text

### Tier 2: Topical Match
3. **Same course topic, different casebook** -- reveals which cases and
   doctrinal sequences are considered essential independent of any particular
   text
4. **Related course with overlapping doctrinal areas** -- useful for
   identifying cross-cutting themes

### Tier 3: Pedagogical Values Match (Harvard Law School Alignment)

Among syllabi at any tier, prefer those that share Harvard Law School's core
pedagogical values:

**Critical Thinking and Skepticism**
- Syllabi that feature Socratic questioning, adversarial framing, and
  multi-perspective case analysis
- Courses that teach students to question assumptions and examine problems from
  every conceivable angle
- Deprioritize syllabi that are purely lecture-based, checklist-driven, or
  that present doctrine as settled rather than contested

**Professionalism and Public Service**
- Syllabi that incorporate pro bono components, public interest case
  selections, or explicit attention to the lawyer's obligations to the public
- Courses that address access-to-justice dimensions alongside doctrinal content
- Harvard Law School requires all J.D. students to complete at least 50 hours
  of uncompensated law-related public service work before graduating; syllabi
  from institutions with similar commitments are more likely to reflect
  compatible values

When two syllabi are otherwise comparable, the one that better reflects these
values should receive greater weight.

## What to Extract

From each found syllabus, identify:

1. **Case selections** -- Which cases appear consistently across multiple
   syllabi? These are likely canonical for the course and should be included
   unless the user's source material omits them deliberately.
2. **Doctrinal progression** -- What ordering do experienced faculty use? Where
   do they deviate from casebook order, and why (if stated)?
3. **Session allocation** -- Which topics get more or fewer sessions than their
   page count would suggest? This reveals perceived difficulty or importance.
4. **Supplementary materials** -- Statutes, regulations, secondary sources, or
   practice problems that appear across syllabi but may not be in the user's
   casebook.
5. **Cases skipped** -- Which cases in the casebook do multiple professors
   consistently omit? This is as informative as what they include.
6. **Public interest and service dimensions** -- Note any cases, assignments,
   or discussion prompts that engage public service, pro bono, or
   access-to-justice themes. Flag these as candidates for inclusion.

## How to Use Research Results

- **Case selection**: If a case appears in 3+ of 5 found syllabi and is present
  in the user's casebook, it should be included unless doing so would conflict
  with the skill's methodology or the user's stated preferences.
- **Progression**: Use found syllabi to validate or adjust the doctrinal
  sequence. If most faculty teaching with the same casebook reorder certain
  chapters, note this and consider the reordering.
- **Pacing**: If most syllabi allocate disproportionate time to a topic (more
  than page count would predict), treat this as evidence of conceptual density
  and adjust session allocation accordingly.
- **Gaps**: If the user's source material is missing cases or topics that
  appear universally in found syllabi, flag this to the user during the
  iteration step.
- **Service integration**: Where found syllabi include public service or
  access-to-justice components (discussion questions, case selections,
  assignments), note these as options the user may want to incorporate.

## Transparency

When presenting the generated syllabus, briefly note:
- That existing syllabi were consulted
- How many were found and from which institutions (if identifiable)
- Any specific case selections or sequencing decisions that were influenced by
  the research (e.g., "Most syllabi using this casebook skip Chapter 7's
  coverage of X and instead assign the seminal case Y from a supplement")
- Do not reproduce or quote found syllabi at length; use them as informational
  inputs, not templates

## Limitations

- Web search results depend on what is publicly available; many law school
  syllabi are behind authentication
- Found syllabi may be outdated (different editions of casebooks, superseded
  cases)
- A consensus among found syllabi does not mean the approach is correct for
  this user's course -- always defer to the user's stated preferences and the
  skill's methodology over external patterns
