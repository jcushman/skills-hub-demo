# Evidence-Based Law School Syllabus Generator

You are building a **modern, evidence-based law school course syllabus** from content the user has provided in this conversation (uploaded PDFs, images of tables of contents, pasted text, or other source material).

## Step 1: Analyze the Provided Content

Before generating anything, carefully review all content the user has shared:
- Identify the subject matter, doctrinal areas, and scope
- Note the ordering and structure of the source material (casebook chapters, topics, case names)
- Identify the total volume of material to be covered
- Map the conceptual difficulty and density of each doctrinal area (some topics require more analytical framework-building than others)
- Ask the user for any missing information you need: number of class sessions, session length, semester duration, credit hours, or whether this is a survey course vs. an advanced seminar

## Step 1.5: Research Existing Syllabi

If the course topic and/or casebook can be identified from Step 1, search for existing syllabi from comparable law school courses before generating the syllabus.

Follow the detailed protocol in `references/syllabus-research-protocol.md`. In summary:

- Search for 3-5 published syllabi matching the course topic and casebook
- Prefer syllabi that are close topical and textbook matches, and among those, prefer syllabi from institutions that share Harvard Law School's pedagogical values: **critical thinking and Socratic skepticism** (questioning assumptions, multi-perspective analysis) and **professionalism and public service** (pro bono integration, access-to-justice awareness)
- Extract patterns: which cases are canonical, what progression faculty use, where they spend extra time, what they skip, and where public interest themes appear
- Use these findings to inform case selections, spiral return points, and difficulty calibration in Step 2 -- not as a template, but as empirical evidence about how experienced faculty structure the same course
- Pay particular attention to where found syllabi allocate disproportionate time; this is evidence of conceptual density that should inform your difficulty-calibrated pacing
- If the user's source material is missing cases or topics that appear universally in found syllabi, flag this during Step 4

If web search is unavailable or no relevant syllabi are found, proceed to Step 2 using only the user-provided content and note this limitation.

## Step 2: Apply Evidence-Based Syllabus Design Principles

Build the syllabus according to the following structural commitments, each grounded in learning science research:

### Backward Design Drives the Sequence
- Start with the question: "What do students need to be able to do by the end, and what sequence of encounters will build that capacity?"
- The doctrinal map from the source material is a resource, not a mandate
- This may still result in a largely traditional sequence (the canonical order exists for good reasons), but the rationale for the sequence must be made explicit and adjustments must be intentional
- State the rationale for sequencing decisions in the syllabus itself

### Spiral Structure Over Linear Blocks
- Rather than covering a topic once and leaving it behind, plan for key doctrines and analytical frameworks to reappear at planned intervals throughout the semester
- For example, a concept introduced early (such as judicial deference during judicial review) should resurface in later contexts (Commerce Clause, substantive due process, equal protection), each time deepening understanding
- This is the single most powerful structural change learning science recommends: spaced re-engagement with material dramatically outperforms single-exposure coverage for long-term retention
- Mark these return points explicitly in the schedule

### Spaced Practice Built into the Calendar
- Explicitly schedule revisitation: cumulative problem sets that reach back to earlier units, "connections" classes that compare frameworks across doctrinal areas, short diagnostics that draw on material from multiple units
- The spacing must be deliberate and visible to students, not left to chance or self-discipline
- Place these at specific points in the calendar and label them clearly

### Interleaving Within Assignments and Class Sessions
- Practice materials should mix doctrinal areas so students must first identify which framework applies (the discrimination step that is often the hardest part of a law school exam)
- Within a single class session, include brief callbacks to earlier material ("How does today's case compare to the structural argument in [earlier case]?") as micro-interleaving
- Note interleaving opportunities in the session descriptions

### Pacing Calibrated to Conceptual Difficulty, Not Page Count
- Allocate more time to topics that are conceptually dense or that require students to master new analytical frameworks, even if the source material devotes similar page counts to each
- Signal this to students in the syllabus: "We will spend three sessions on [topic] because the [framework] is a skill you will use throughout the rest of the course"

### Scaffolded Complexity Across the Semester
- Earlier units provide more structure: guided issue-spotting, step-by-step analytical frameworks, worked examples
- Later units progressively remove scaffolding, requiring students to select and apply frameworks independently
- State this progression in the syllabus: "By Unit X, you will be constructing arguments without a framework checklist"

### Cumulative Assessments Replace Unit-Based Tests
- If there are midterm checkpoints or practice assessments, make them cumulative rather than limited to the most recent block
- This prevents the "learn it, test it, forget it" pattern
- Even if the course retains a single final exam, earlier low-stakes exercises that draw on multiple units rehearse the integration skill the final demands

### Explicit "Connection Points" in the Schedule
- Mark sessions or assignments whose purpose is synthesis rather than new coverage
- These are not review sessions (re-covering old ground before a test) but new analytical work that uses earlier material as inputs
- Example: "This week we step back to compare the structural reasoning in federalism cases with the liberty reasoning in due process cases"

### Transparent Rationale for Pacing
- Tell students why the course revisits earlier material, why problem sets mix topics, and why some units get more time than others
- This transparency supports metacognition: students begin to understand how their own learning works, not just what they are learning
- Include brief rationale notes in the syllabus schedule itself

## Step 3: Generate the Syllabus

Produce a complete, formatted syllabus that includes:

1. **Course header**: Course title, credit hours, prerequisites (if apparent from context)
2. **Course description**: 2-3 sentences summarizing both the doctrinal scope and the pedagogical approach
3. **A note on course design**: A short paragraph (visible to students) explaining that the course uses evidence-based techniques including spaced practice, interleaving, and scaffolded complexity, and what students should expect as a result (e.g., "You will encounter earlier topics again in new contexts throughout the semester. This is intentional and grounded in research on how durable learning works.")
4. **Learning objectives**: 4-6 objectives focused on both doctrinal knowledge and transferable analytical skills
5. **Required materials**: Drawn from the source material the user provided
6. **Assessment structure**: Emphasizing cumulative and low-stakes assessments throughout the semester, with the final exam as the capstone rather than the sole integration point
7. **Session-by-session schedule**: Each class session with:
   - Session number and date placeholder (or actual dates if provided)
   - Topic/doctrinal area
   - Specific reading assignments (cases, pages, chapters) drawn from the provided content
   - **Spiral markers**: Where this session connects back to earlier material, marked with a label like "[Spiral: connects to Session X - topic]"
   - **Scaffolding level**: An indication of how much structure is provided (e.g., "Guided framework" early on, "Independent analysis" later)
   - Brief rationale note where pacing or ordering departs from source material sequence
8. **Spaced practice touchpoints**: Cumulative problem sets, connection classes, and diagnostic exercises placed at specific calendar points
9. **Synthesis sessions**: Dedicated sessions for cross-doctrinal comparison (distinct from review sessions)

## Step 4: Confirm and Iterate

After presenting the syllabus, ask the user:
- Whether the spiral return points feel appropriate (too frequent? too sparse?)
- Whether the difficulty calibration matches their sense of which topics are hardest for students
- Whether they want to adjust the scaffolding progression
- Whether they want to add participation requirements, attendance policies, or other standard syllabus components
