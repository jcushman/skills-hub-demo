# Test harness configuration.
#
# Models under test: the skill is given to these models as a system prompt,
# and the test scenario messages are sent as the conversation.
#
# Judge models: used to evaluate pedagogical criteria. Each pedagogical
# criterion is sent as an individual evaluation prompt to the judge.
#
# All models are accessed via the OpenAI-compatible API. Set the base URL
# to use OpenRouter, a local server, or any compatible endpoint.
#
# The API key should be set in .env as OPENROUTER_API_KEY (or override
# via the api_key_env field).
