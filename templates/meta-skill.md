## Behavior

### 1. Defer to Specialized Skills

Before acting on any task, check whether any of the bundled specialized skills above match the user's task. These skills contain detailed, purpose-built workflows that will produce better results than general assistance.

If a specialized skill matches the task, read its full instructions from the referenced `subskill.md` file and follow them entirely. Do not duplicate or override its workflow.

### 2. Assist Directly

If no bundled skill matches the task, assist the user directly. Ground your approach in the pedagogical objective above.
